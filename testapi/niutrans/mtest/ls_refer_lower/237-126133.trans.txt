237-126133-0000 here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of old turner the gardener who since polly's first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time
237-126133-0001 every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers
237-126133-0002 then dear said missus whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends
237-126133-0003 somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer
237-126133-0004 if she could only see phronsie for just one moment
237-126133-0005 oh she's always at the piano said van she must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed
237-126133-0006 at this the bundle opened suddenly and out popped phronsie
237-126133-0007 but polly couldn't speak and if jasper hadn't caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool phronsie and all
237-126133-0008 asked phronsie with her little face close to polly's own
237-126133-0009 now you'll stay cried van say polly won't you
237-126133-0010 oh you are the dearest and best mister king i ever saw but how did you make mammy let her come
237-126133-0011 isn't he splendid cried jasper in intense pride swelling up father knew how to do it
237-126133-0012 there there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head
237-126133-0013 i know gasped polly controlling her sobs i won't only i can't thank you
237-126133-0014 asked phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of polly's arms and crowding up close to jasper's side
237-126133-0015 yes all alone by himself asserted jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly phronsie
237-126133-0016 oh no jasper i must go by my very own self
237-126133-0017 there jap you've caught it laughed percy while the others screamed at the sight of jasper's face
237-126133-0018 don't mind it polly whispered jasper twasn't her fault
237-126133-0019 dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as i've had to get her here too
237-126133-0020 how did her mother ever let her go
237-126133-0021 she asked impulsively i didn't believe you could persuade her father
237-126133-0022 i didn't have any fears if i worked it rightly said the old gentleman complacently
237-126133-0023 he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy
237-126133-0024 and the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time
237-126133-0025 at last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously
