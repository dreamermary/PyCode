6829-68769-0000 kenneth and beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers's visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check
6829-68769-0001 it was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in state's prison as a consequence of his rash act
6829-68769-0002 i can't see it in that light said the old lawyer
6829-68769-0003 it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved
6829-68769-0004 but they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff
6829-68769-0005 he was soft hearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost
6829-68769-0006 if the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom
6829-68769-0007 but under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made
6829-68769-0008 fairview was twelve miles away but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county jail
6829-68769-0009 they were received in the little office by a man named markham who was the jailer
6829-68769-0010 we wish to talk with him answered kenneth talk
6829-68769-0011 i'm running for representative on the republican ticket said kenneth quietly
6829-68769-0012 oh say that's different observed markham altering his demeanor
6829-68769-0013 may we see gates at once asked kenneth
6829-68769-0014 they followed the jailer along a succession of passages
6829-68769-0015 sometimes i'm that yearning for a smoke i'm nearly crazy an i dunno which is worst dyin one way or another
6829-68769-0016 he unlocked the door and called here's visitors tom
6829-68769-0017 worse tom worse n ever replied the jailer gloomily
6829-68769-0018 miss de graf said kenneth noticing the boy's face critically as he stood where the light from the passage fell upon it
6829-68769-0019 sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail
6829-68769-0020 sit down please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a bench here
6829-68769-0021 a fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth
6829-68769-0022 we have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it
6829-68769-0023 i didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did
6829-68769-0024 old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident
6829-68769-0025 then rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin
6829-68769-0026 he spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them
6829-68769-0027 whose name did you sign to the check asked kenneth
6829-68769-0028 he is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern
6829-68769-0029 it's a stock company and rich
6829-68769-0030 i was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature
6829-68769-0031 as regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved them a heavy loss one day
6829-68769-0032 i discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant but marshall never even thanked me
6829-68769-0033 it was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth
6829-68769-0034 i'm going to see mister marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir
6829-68769-0035 it won't be much but i'm grateful to find a friend
6829-68769-0036 they left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office
6829-68769-0037 i've seen lots of that kind in my day
6829-68769-0038 and it ruins a man's disposition
6829-68769-0039 he looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated
6829-68769-0040 some girl has been here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her
6829-68769-0041 i'm not electioneering just now
6829-68769-0042 oh well sir what about him
6829-68769-0043 and he deserves a term in state's prison
6829-68769-0044 it has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance
6829-68769-0045 i'll pay all the costs besides
6829-68769-0046 you're foolish why should you do all this
6829-68769-0047 i have my own reasons mister marshall
6829-68769-0048 give me a check for a hundred and fifty and i'll turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings
6829-68769-0049 he detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young gates
6829-68769-0050 beth uneasy at his silence nudged him
6829-68769-0051 there was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face
6829-68769-0052 he might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp
6829-68769-0053 and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars
