2961-960-0000 he passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense
2961-960-0001 the influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding
2961-960-0002 in the supposed depths of this dialogue the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato
2961-960-0003 they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all
2961-960-0004 there is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neo platonists
2961-960-0005 in the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought
2961-960-0006 the fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day
2961-960-0007 but they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him
2961-960-0008 we do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind
2961-960-0009 the dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals
2961-960-0010 but he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul
2961-960-0011 with heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number
2961-960-0012 many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus
2961-960-0013 it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life
2961-960-0014 the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes
2961-960-0015 the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogues
2961-960-0016 but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium
2961-960-0017 nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner
2961-960-0018 but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up
2961-960-0019 he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena
2961-960-0020 and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius
2961-960-0021 there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in plato's earlier writings
2961-960-0022 plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art
