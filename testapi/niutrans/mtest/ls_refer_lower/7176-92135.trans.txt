7176-92135-0000 he is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elect who are always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him editors allow him to contribute without charge to a symposium on the price of golf balls
7176-92135-0001 in short he becomes a prominent figure in london society and if he is not careful somebody will say so
7176-92135-0002 but even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments
7176-92135-0003 your play must be not merely a good play but a successful one
7176-92135-0004 frankly i cannot always say
7176-92135-0005 but suppose you said i'm fond of writing my people always say my letters home are good enough for punch
7176-92135-0006 i've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman and but perhaps i'd better keep the plot a secret for the moment
7176-92135-0007 anyhow it's jolly exciting and i can do the dialogue all right
7176-92135-0008 lend me your ear for ten minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is
7176-92135-0009 and i should begin with a short homily on soliloquy
7176-92135-0010 ham to be or not to be
7176-92135-0011 now the object of this soliloquy is plain
7176-92135-0012 indeed irresolution being the keynote of hamlet's soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a silent working of the jaw but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatist's meaning
7176-92135-0013 we moderns however see the absurdity of it
7176-92135-0014 if it be granted first that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience and secondly that soliloquy or the habit of thinking aloud is in opposition to modern stage technique how shall a soliloquy be avoided without damage to the play
7176-92135-0015 and so on till you get to the end when ophelia might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort
7176-92135-0016 this would be an easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself
7176-92135-0017 in the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence
7176-92135-0018 in the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells him what he is going to do could anything be more natural
7176-92135-0019 i want double nine hal lo
7176-92135-0020 double nine two three elsinore double nine yes hallo is that you horatio hamlet speaking
7176-92135-0021 i say i've been wondering about this business
7176-92135-0022 to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows what no hamlet speaking
7176-92135-0023 you gave me double five i want double nine hallo is that you horatio hamlet speaking
7176-92135-0024 to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler
7176-92135-0025 it is to let hamlet if that happen to be the name of your character enter with a small dog pet falcon mongoose tame bear or whatever animal is most in keeping with the part and confide in this animal such sorrows hopes or secret history as the audience has got to know
7176-92135-0026 enter hamlet with his favourite boar hound
7176-92135-0027 lady larkspur starts suddenly and turns towards him
7176-92135-0028 larkspur bit me again this morning for the third time
7176-92135-0029 i want to get away from it all swoons
7176-92135-0030 enter lord arthur fluffinose
7176-92135-0031 and there you are you will of course appreciate that the unfinished sentences not only save time but also make the manoeuvring very much more natural
7176-92135-0032 how you may be wondering are you to begin your masterpiece
7176-92135-0033 relapses into silence for the rest of the evening
7176-92135-0034 the duchess of southbridge to lord reggie oh reggie what did you say
7176-92135-0035 then lord tuppeny well what about auction
7176-92135-0036 the crowd drifts off leaving the hero and heroine alone in the middle of the stage and then you can begin
7176-92135-0037 then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage
7176-92135-0038 a stage meal is popular because it proves to the audience that the actors even when called charles hawtrey or owen nares are real people just like you and me
7176-92135-0039 tea please matthews butler impassively
7176-92135-0040 hostess replaces lump and inclines empty teapot over tray for a moment then hands him a cup painted brown inside thus deceiving the gentleman with the telescope in the upper circle
7176-92135-0041 re enter butler and three footmen who remove the tea things hostess to guest
7176-92135-0042 in novels the hero has often pushed his meals away untasted but no stage hero would do anything so unnatural as this
7176-92135-0043 two bites are made and the bread is crumbled with an air of great eagerness indeed one feels that in real life the guest would clutch hold of the footman and say half a mo old chap i haven't nearly finished but the actor is better schooled than this
7176-92135-0044 but it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection
7176-92135-0045 lord john taking out gold cigarette case from his left hand upper waistcoat pocket
