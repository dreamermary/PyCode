1580-141083-0000 i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place or give a clue as to the people concerned
1580-141083-0001 i had always known him to be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred
1580-141083-0002 my friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street
1580-141083-0003 without his scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an uncomfortable man
1580-141083-0004 i had to read it over carefully as the text must be absolutely correct
1580-141083-0005 i was absent rather more than an hour
1580-141083-0006 the only duplicate which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my servant bannister a man who has looked after my room for ten years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion
1580-141083-0007 the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers
1580-141083-0008 the proof was in three long slips i had left them all together
1580-141083-0009 the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and had entered to look at the papers
1580-141083-0010 i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while i made a most careful examination of the room
1580-141083-0011 a broken tip of lead was lying there also
1580-141083-0012 not only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it
1580-141083-0013 above all things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly
1580-141083-0014 to the best of my belief they were rolled up
1580-141083-0015 did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer
1580-141083-0016 i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open
1580-141083-0017 so it seems to me
1580-141083-0018 now mister soames at your disposal
1580-141083-0019 above were three students one on each story
1580-141083-0020 then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck craned he looked into the room
1580-141083-0021 there is no opening except the one pane said our learned guide
1580-141083-0022 i am afraid there are no signs here said he
1580-141083-0023 one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day
1580-141083-0024 you left him in a chair you say which chair by the window there
1580-141083-0025 the man entered and took the papers sheet by sheet from the central table
1580-141083-0026 as a matter of fact he could not said soames for i entered by the side door
1580-141083-0027 how long would it take him to do that using every possible contraction a quarter of an hour not less
1580-141083-0028 then he tossed it down and seized the next
1580-141083-0029 he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there
1580-141083-0030 mister soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information
1580-141083-0031 holmes held out a small chip with the letters n n and a space of clear wood after them you see
1580-141083-0032 watson i have always done you an injustice there are others
1580-141083-0033 i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface no i see nothing
1580-141083-0034 as holmes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an emergency
1580-141083-0035 holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor halloa what's this
1580-141083-0036 holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light
1580-141083-0037 what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself
1580-141083-0038 i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing your door yes there are
1580-141083-0039 and they are all in for this examination yes
1580-141083-0040 one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs
1580-141083-0041 let us hear the suspicions i will look after the proofs
1580-141083-0042 my scholar has been left very poor but he is hard working and industrious he will do well
1580-141083-0043 the top floor belongs to miles mc laren
1580-141083-0044 i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps the least unlikely
1580-141083-0045 he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life
1580-141083-0046 but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times
1580-141083-0047 did you look at these papers on the table
1580-141083-0048 how came you to leave the key in the door
1580-141083-0049 anyone in the room could get out yes sir
1580-141083-0050 i really don't think he knew much about it mister holmes
1580-141083-0051 only for a minute or so
1580-141083-0052 oh i would not venture to say sir
1580-141083-0053 you haven't seen any of them no sir
