908-31957-0000 all is said without a word
908-31957-0001 i sit beneath thy looks as children do in the noon sun with souls that tremble through their happy eyelids from an unaverred yet prodigal inward joy
908-31957-0002 i did not wrong myself so but i placed a wrong on thee
908-31957-0003 when called before i told how hastily i dropped my flowers or brake off from a game
908-31957-0004 shall i never miss home talk and blessing and the common kiss that comes to each in turn nor count it strange when i look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this
908-31957-0005 alas i have grieved so i am hard to love
908-31957-0006 open thy heart wide and fold within the wet wings of thy dove
908-31957-0007 could it mean to last a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow
908-31957-0008 nay i rather thrilled distrusting every light that seemed to gild the onward path and feared to overlean a finger even
908-31957-0009 and though i have grown serene and strong since then i think that god has willed a still renewable fear
908-31957-0010 o love o troth
908-31957-0011 and love be false
908-31957-0012 if he to keep one oath must lose one joy by his life's star foretold
908-31957-0013 slow to world greetings quick with its o list when the angels speak
908-31957-0014 a ring of amethyst i could not wear here plainer to my sight than that first kiss
908-31957-0015 that was the chrism of love which love's own crown with sanctifying sweetness did precede the third upon my lips was folded down in perfect purple state since when indeed i have been proud and said my love my own
908-31957-0016 dearest teach me so to pour out gratitude as thou dost good
908-31957-0017 mussulmans and giaours throw kerchiefs at a smile and have no ruth for any weeping
908-31957-0018 but thou art not such a lover my beloved
908-31957-0019 thou canst wait through sorrow and sickness to bring souls to touch and think it soon when others cry too late
908-31957-0020 i thank all who have loved me in their hearts with thanks and love from mine
908-31957-0021 oh to shoot my soul's full meaning into future years that they should lend it utterance and salute love that endures from life that disappears
908-31957-0022 then i long tried by natural ills received the comfort fast while budding at thy sight my pilgrim's staff gave out green leaves with morning dews impearled
908-31957-0023 i love thee freely as men strive for right i love thee purely as they turn from praise
908-31957-0024 i love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhood's faith
908-31957-0025 i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breath smiles tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee better after death
