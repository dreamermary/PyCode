2830-3979-0000 we want you to help us publish some leading work of luther's for the general american market will you do it
2830-3979-0001 the condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to americans
2830-3979-0002 let us begin with that his commentary on galatians
2830-3979-0003 the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive
2830-3979-0004 it was written in latin
2830-3979-0005 the work had to be condensed
2830-3979-0006 a word should now be said about the origin of luther's commentary on galatians
2830-3979-0007 much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my galatians for instance
2830-3979-0008 in other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians and roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer
2830-3979-0009 it presents like no other of luther's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ's merits alone
2830-3979-0010 but the essence of luther's lectures is there
2830-3979-0011 the lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let him also give us the power to serve and to do luke two
2830-3979-0012 the word of our god shall stand forever
