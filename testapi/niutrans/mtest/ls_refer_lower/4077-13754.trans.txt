4077-13754-0000 the army found the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth
4077-13754-0001 but a word further concerning the expedition in general
4077-13754-0002 it was through floyd's advice that buchanan ordered the military expedition to utah ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists
4077-13754-0003 moreover had the people been inclined to rebellion what greater opportunity could they have wished
4077-13754-0004 already a north and a south were talked of why not set up also a west
4077-13754-0005 they knew no north no south no east no west they stood positively by the constitution and would have nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they had already once loyally responded to furnish men and arms for their country's need
4077-13754-0006 what the latter day saints call celestial marriage is characteristic of the church and is in very general practise but of celestial marriage plurality of wives was an incident never an essential
4077-13754-0007 we believe in a literal resurrection and an actual hereafter in which future state shall be recognized every sanctified and authorized relationship existing here on earth of parent and child brother and sister husband and wife
4077-13754-0008 it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one and i have yet to find the place and meet the people where and with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious than among the maligned mormons in the mountain valleys of the west
4077-13754-0009 at the inception of plural marriage among the latter day saints there was no law national or state against its practise
4077-13754-0010 in eighteen sixty two a law was enacted with the purpose of suppressing plural marriage and as had been predicted in the national senate prior to its passage it lay for many years a dead letter
4077-13754-0011 federal judges and united states attorneys in utah who were not mormons nor lovers of mormonism refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy
4077-13754-0012 this meant that for an alleged misdemeanor for which congress prescribed a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of three hundred dollars a man might be imprisoned for life aye for many terms of a man's natural life did the court's power to enforce its sentences extend so far and might be fined millions of dollars
4077-13754-0013 before this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and there meet with the reversal and rebuke it deserved men were imprisoned under sentences of many years duration
4077-13754-0014 the people contested these measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure
4077-13754-0015 then the church was disincorporated and its property both real and personal confiscated and escheated to the government of the united states and although the personal property was soon restored real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the court's receiver and the mormon church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property
4077-13754-0016 and so the story of mormonism runs on its finale has not yet been written the current press presents continuously new stages of its progress new developments of its plan
