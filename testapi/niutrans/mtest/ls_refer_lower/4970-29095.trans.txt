4970-29095-0000 she was tired of other things
4970-29095-0001 she tried this morning an air or two upon the piano sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic voice and then seating herself by the open window read philip's letter
4970-29095-0002 well mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impatience
4970-29095-0003 i hope thee told the elders that father and i are responsible for the piano and that much as thee loves music thee is never in the room when it is played
4970-29095-0004 i heard father tell cousin abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now
4970-29095-0005 thy ways greatly try me ruth and all thy relations
4970-29095-0006 is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's people
4970-29095-0007 i have not asked him ruth replied with a look that might imply that she was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers
4970-29095-0008 mother i'm going to study medicine
4970-29095-0009 margaret bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity
4970-29095-0010 thee study medicine
4970-29095-0011 does thee think thee could stand it six months
4970-29095-0012 and besides suppose thee does learn medicine
4970-29095-0013 i will practice it
4970-29095-0014 where thee and thy family are known
4970-29095-0015 if i can get patients
4970-29095-0016 ruth sat quite still for a time with face intent and flushed it was out now
4970-29095-0017 the sight seers returned in high spirits from the city
4970-29095-0018 ruth asked the enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum with its great halls and echoing rooms and no comfortable place in it for the accommodation of any body
4970-29095-0019 and then there was broad street
4970-29095-0020 there certainly was no end to it and even ruth was philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end or architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest
4970-29095-0021 but neither saint girard nor broad street neither wonders of the mint nor the glories of the hall where the ghosts of our fathers sit always signing the declaration impressed the visitors so much as the splendors of the chestnut street windows and the bargains on eighth street
4970-29095-0022 is thee going to the yearly meeting ruth asked one of the girls
4970-29095-0023 i have nothing to wear replied that demure person
4970-29095-0024 it has occupied mother a long time to find at the shops the exact shade for her new bonnet
4970-29095-0025 and thee won't go why should i
4970-29095-0026 if i go to meeting at all i like best to sit in the quiet old house in germantown where the windows are all open and i can see the trees and hear the stir of the leaves
4970-29095-0027 it's such a crush at the yearly meeting at arch street and then there's the row of sleek looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us as we come out
4970-29095-0028 he doesn't say but it's on the frontier and on the map everything beyond it is marked indians and desert and looks as desolate as a wednesday meeting humph it was time for him to do something
4970-29095-0029 is he going to start a daily newspaper among the kick a poos
4970-29095-0030 father thee's unjust to philip he's going into business
4970-29095-0031 he doesn't say exactly what it is said ruth a little dubiously but it's something about land and railroads and thee knows father that fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how in a new country
4970-29095-0032 but philip is honest and he has talent enough if he will stop scribbling to make his way
4970-29095-0033 what a box women are put into measured for it and put in young if we go anywhere it's in a box veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities
4970-29095-0034 why should i rust and be stupid and sit in inaction because i am a girl
4970-29095-0035 and if i had a fortune would thee want me to lead a useless life
4970-29095-0036 has thee consulted thy mother about a career i suppose it is a career thee wants
4970-29095-0037 but that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than ruth understood herself
4970-29095-0038 ruth was glad to hear that philip had made a push into the world and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him
