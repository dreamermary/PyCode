5142-36377-0000 it was one of the masterly and charming stories of dumas the elder
5142-36377-0001 in five minutes i was in a new world and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest french company
5142-36377-0002 the sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality
5142-36377-0003 ambrose met me at the bottom of the stairs and showed me the way to the supper room
5142-36377-0004 she signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father
5142-36377-0005 the door opened again while i was still studying the two brothers without i honestly confess being very favorably impressed by either of them
5142-36377-0006 a new member of the family circle who instantly attracted my attention entered the room
5142-36377-0007 a little cracked that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room
5142-36377-0008 mister meadowcroft the elder having not spoken one word thus far himself introduced the newcomer to me with a side glance at his sons which had something like defiance in it a glance which as i was sorry to notice was returned with the defiance on their side by the two young men
5142-36377-0009 philip lefrank this is my overlooker mister jago said the old man formally presenting us
5142-36377-0010 he is not well he has come over the ocean for rest and change of scene
5142-36377-0011 mister jago is an american philip
5142-36377-0012 make acquaintance with mister jago sit together
5142-36377-0013 they pointedly drew back from john jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table
5142-36377-0014 a pretty girl and so far as i could judge by appearances a good girl too describing her generally i may say that she had a small head well carried and well set on her shoulders bright gray eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked a trim slight little figure too slight for our english notions of beauty a strong american accent and a rare thing in america a pleasantly toned voice which made the accent agreeable to english ears
5142-36377-0015 our first impressions of people are in nine cases out of ten the right impressions
5142-36377-0016 for once in a way i proved a true prophet
5142-36377-0017 the only cheerful conversation was the conversation across the table between naomi and me
5142-36377-0018 he looked up at naomi doubtingly from his plate and looked down again slowly with a frown
5142-36377-0019 when i addressed him he answered constrainedly
5142-36377-0020 a more dreary and more disunited family party i never sat at the table with
5142-36377-0021 envy hatred malice and uncharitableness are never so essentially detestable to my mind as when they are animated by a sense of propriety and work under the surface but for my interest in naomi and my other interest in the little love looks which i now and then surprised passing between her and ambrose i should never have sat through that supper
5142-36377-0022 i wish you good night she laid her bony hands on the back of mister meadowcroft's invalid chair cut him short in his farewell salutation to me and wheeled him out to his bed as if she were wheeling him out to his grave
5142-36377-0023 you were quite right to say no ambrose began never smoke with john jago his cigars will poison you
5142-36377-0024 naomi shook her forefinger reproachfully at them as if the two sturdy young farmers had been two children
5142-36377-0025 silas slunk away without a word of protest ambrose stood his ground evidently bent on making his peace with naomi before he left her seeing that i was in the way i walked aside toward a glass door at the lower end of the room
