2961-961-0000 socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic
2961-961-0001 and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle
2961-961-0002 and therefore to you i turn timaeus citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher and a statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse
2961-961-0003 i will if timaeus approves i approve
2961-961-0004 listen then socrates to a tale of solon's who being the friend of dropidas my great grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me
2961-961-0005 some poems of solon were recited by the boys
2961-961-0006 and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark
2961-961-0007 the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged
2961-961-0008 but the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors
2961-961-0009 tell us said the other the whole story and where solon heard the story
2961-961-0010 but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples
2961-961-0011 the genealogies which you have recited to us out of your own annals solon are a mere children's story
2961-961-0012 for in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven
2961-961-0013 solon marvelled and desired to be informed of the particulars
2961-961-0014 nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours and eight thousand since she founded ours as our annals record
2961-961-0015 many laws exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time
2961-961-0016 i will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers
2961-961-0017 observe again what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of man
2961-961-0018 the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of atlantis
2961-961-0019 for at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled the invader and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars
2961-961-0020 this is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean
2961-961-0021 but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory
2961-961-0022 then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of man and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record spoke
