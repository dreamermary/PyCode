7127-75947-0000 every one could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed
7127-75947-0001 upon this madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte observing
7127-75947-0002 do you think so she replied with indifference
7127-75947-0003 yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own
7127-75947-0004 explain yourself
7127-75947-0005 i allude to the goddess
7127-75947-0006 the princess inquired no
7127-75947-0007 she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance
7127-75947-0008 the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally
7127-75947-0009 a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theater but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart
7127-75947-0010 when she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself
7127-75947-0011 remain i implore you the evening is most lovely
7127-75947-0012 indeed ah
7127-75947-0013 i remember now and i congratulate myself do you love any one
7127-75947-0014 forgive me i hardly know what i am saying a thousand times forgive me madame was right quite right this brutal exile has completely turned my brain
7127-75947-0015 there cannot be a doubt he received you kindly for in fact you returned without his permission
7127-75947-0016 oh mademoiselle why have i not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself
7127-75947-0017 what already here they said to her
7127-75947-0018 i have been here this quarter of an hour replied la valliere
7127-75947-0019 did not the dancing amuse you no
7127-75947-0020 no more than the dancing
7127-75947-0021 la valliere is quite a poetess said tonnay charente
7127-75947-0022 i am a woman and there are few like me whoever loves me flatters me whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases well said montalais you do not finish
7127-75947-0023 it is too difficult replied mademoiselle de tonnay charente laughing loudly
7127-75947-0024 look yonder do you not see the moon slowly rising silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks
7127-75947-0025 exquisite soft turf of the woods the happiness which your friendship confers upon me
7127-75947-0026 well said mademoiselle de tonnay charente i also think a good deal but i take care
7127-75947-0027 to say nothing said montalais so that when mademoiselle de tonnay charente thinks athenais is the only one who knows it
7127-75947-0028 quick quick then among the high reed grass said montalais stoop athenais you are so tall
7127-75947-0029 the young girls had indeed made themselves small indeed invisible
7127-75947-0030 she was here just now said the count
7127-75947-0031 you are positive then
7127-75947-0032 yes but perhaps i frightened her in what way
7127-75947-0033 how is it la valliere said mademoiselle de tonnay charente that the vicomte de bragelonne spoke of you as louise
7127-75947-0034 it seems the king will not consent to it
7127-75947-0035 good gracious has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind
7127-75947-0036 i give my consent
7127-75947-0037 oh i am speaking seriously replied montalais and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's i suppose is it not louise
7127-75947-0038 let us run then said all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest covert of the park
7127-75947-0039 in fact the sound of madame's and the queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mounted cavaliers
7127-75947-0040 in this way the fete of the whole court was a fete also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the deer in the brake the pheasant on the branch the fox in its hole were all listening
