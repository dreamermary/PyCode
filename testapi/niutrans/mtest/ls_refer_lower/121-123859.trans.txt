121-123859-0000 you are my all the world and i must strive to know my shames and praises from your tongue none else to me nor i to none alive that my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong
121-123859-0001 o tis the first tis flattery in my seeing and my great mind most kingly drinks it up mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing and to his palate doth prepare the cup if it be poison'd tis the lesser sin that mine eye loves it and doth first begin
121-123859-0002 but reckoning time whose million'd accidents creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp'st intents divert strong minds to the course of altering things alas why fearing of time's tyranny might i not then say now i love you best when i was certain o'er incertainty crowning the present doubting of the rest
121-123859-0003 love is a babe then might i not say so to give full growth to that which still doth grow
121-123859-0004 so i return rebuk'd to my content and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent
