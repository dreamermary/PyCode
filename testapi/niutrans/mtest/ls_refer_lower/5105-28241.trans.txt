5105-28241-0000 her sea going qualities were excellent and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe
5105-28241-0001 after an apprenticeship on a merchant ship he had entered the imperial navy and had already reached the rank of lieutenant when the count appointed him to the charge of his own private yacht in which he was accustomed to spend by far the greater part of his time throughout the winter generally cruising in the mediterranean whilst in the summer he visited more northern waters
5105-28241-0002 the late astounding events however had rendered procope manifestly uneasy and not the less so from his consciousness that the count secretly partook of his own anxiety
5105-28241-0003 steam up and canvas spread the schooner started eastwards
5105-28241-0004 although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented
5105-28241-0005 for a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of algeria but no land appeared to the south
5105-28241-0006 the log and the compass therefore were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant which had become utterly useless
5105-28241-0007 there is no fear of that sir
5105-28241-0008 the earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated onto the sun
5105-28241-0009 and what demonstration do you offer asked servadac eagerly that it will not happen
5105-28241-0010 ocean reigned supreme
5105-28241-0011 all the images of his past life floated upon his memory his thoughts sped away to his native france only to return again to wonder whether the depths of ocean would reveal any traces of the algerian metropolis
5105-28241-0012 is it not impossible he murmured aloud that any city should disappear so completely
5105-28241-0013 would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible
5105-28241-0014 another circumstance was most remarkable
5105-28241-0015 to the surprise of all and especially of lieutenant procope the line indicated a bottom at a nearly uniform depth of from four to five fathoms and although the sounding was persevered with continuously for more than two hours over a considerable area the differences of level were insignificant not corresponding in any degree to what would be expected over the site of a city that had been terraced like the seats of an amphitheater
5105-28241-0016 you must see lieutenant i should think that we are not so near the coast of algeria as you imagined
5105-28241-0017 after pondering awhile he said if we were farther away i should expect to find a depth of two or three hundred fathoms instead of five fathoms five fathoms
5105-28241-0018 its depth remained invariable still four or at most five fathoms and although its bottom was assiduously dredged it was only to prove it barren of marine production of any type
5105-28241-0019 nothing was to be done but to put about and return in disappointment towards the north
