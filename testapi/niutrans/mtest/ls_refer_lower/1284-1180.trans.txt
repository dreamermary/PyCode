1284-1180-0000 he wore blue silk stockings blue knee pants with gold buckles a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold
1284-1180-0001 his hat had a peaked crown and a flat brim and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved
1284-1180-0002 instead of shoes the old man wore boots with turnover tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid
1284-1180-0003 for a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful land of oz in which they lived
1284-1180-0004 when they were outside unc simply latched the door and started up the path
1284-1180-0005 no one would disturb their little house even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone
1284-1180-0006 at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins from the country of the gillikins the path divided
1284-1180-0007 he knew it would take them to the house of the crooked magician whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor
1284-1180-0008 all the morning they trudged up the mountain path and at noon unc and ojo sat on a fallen tree trunk and ate the last of the bread which the old munchkin had placed in his pocket
1284-1180-0009 then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor pipt
1284-1180-0010 unc knocked at the door of the house and a chubby pleasant faced woman dressed all in blue opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile
1284-1180-0011 i am my dear and all strangers are welcome to my home
1284-1180-0012 we have come from a far lonelier place than this a lonelier place
1284-1180-0013 and you must be ojo the unlucky she added
1284-1180-0014 ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life
1284-1180-0015 we are traveling replied ojo and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves
1284-1180-0016 the woman seemed thoughtful
1284-1180-0017 at one end stood a great fireplace in which a blue log was blazing with a blue flame and over the fire hung four kettles in a row all bubbling and steaming at a great rate
1284-1180-0018 it takes me several years to make this magic powder but at this moment i am pleased to say it is nearly done you see i am making it for my good wife margolotte who wants to use some of it for a purpose of her own
1284-1180-0019 you must know said margolotte when they were all seated together on the broad window seat that my husband foolishly gave away all the powder of life he first made to old mombi the witch who used to live in the country of the gillikins to the north of here
1284-1180-0020 the first lot we tested on our glass cat which not only began to live but has lived ever since
1284-1180-0021 i think the next glass cat the magician makes will have neither brains nor heart for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some use to us
1284-1180-0022 i'm afraid i don't know much about the land of oz
1284-1180-0023 you see i've lived all my life with unc nunkie the silent one and there was no one to tell me anything
1284-1180-0024 that is one reason you are ojo the unlucky said the woman in a sympathetic tone
1284-1180-0025 i think i must show you my patchwork girl said margolotte laughing at the boy's astonishment for she is rather difficult to explain
1284-1180-0026 but first i will tell you that for many years i have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the dishes
1284-1180-0027 yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose
1284-1180-0028 a bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth all neatly sewed together
1284-1180-0029 sometimes it is called a crazy quilt because the patches and colors are so mixed up
1284-1180-0030 when i found it i said to myself that it would do nicely for my servant girl for when she was brought to life she would not be proud nor haughty as the glass cat is for such a dreadful mixture of colors would discourage her from trying to be as dignified as the blue munchkins are
1284-1180-0031 at the emerald city where our princess ozma lives green is the popular color
1284-1180-0032 i will show you what a good job i did and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors
