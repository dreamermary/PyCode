8230-279154-0000 the analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise
8230-279154-0001 what is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates images and expectations of their usual correlates all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation
8230-279154-0002 whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions everyone would agree that is has a broad measure of truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions
8230-279154-0003 and what sort of evidence is logically possible
8230-279154-0004 there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past
8230-279154-0005 all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember
8230-279154-0006 the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour has to trust his memory in making the record
8230-279154-0007 habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times
8230-279154-0008 but i do not think such an inference is warranted
8230-279154-0009 our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image
8230-279154-0010 we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted
8230-279154-0011 some images like some sensations feel very familiar while others feel strange
8230-279154-0012 familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees
8230-279154-0013 in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts
8230-279154-0014 i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past
8230-279154-0015 they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past
8230-279154-0016 in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event
8230-279154-0017 there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned
8230-279154-0018 there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events
8230-279154-0019 it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events
8230-279154-0020 if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple
8230-279154-0021 remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered
8230-279154-0022 some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at
8230-279154-0023 in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague
8230-279154-0024 the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past
8230-279154-0025 we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy
8230-279154-0026 this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory
8230-279154-0027 a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe
8230-279154-0028 i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this
8230-279154-0029 the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it
8230-279154-0030 semon's two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely
8230-279154-0031 they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory
8230-279154-0032 it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge
8230-279154-0033 it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time
8230-279154-0034 whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar
8230-279154-0035 thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone
8230-279154-0036 a further stage is recognition
8230-279154-0037 recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment
8230-279154-0038 we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word
8230-279154-0039 this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not
8230-279154-0040 there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before
8230-279154-0041 the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important
8230-279154-0042 thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world
8230-279154-0043 of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition
