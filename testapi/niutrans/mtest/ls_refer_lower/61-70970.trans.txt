61-70970-0000 young fitzooth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the squire
61-70970-0001 there befell an anxious interview mistress fitzooth arguing for and against the squire's project in a breath
61-70970-0002 most of all robin thought of his father what would he counsel
61-70970-0003 if for a whim you beggar yourself i cannot stay you
61-70970-0004 but take it whilst i live and wear montfichet's shield in the days when my eyes can be rejoiced by so brave a sight for you will ne'er disgrace our scutcheon i warrant me
61-70970-0005 the lad had checked him then
61-70970-0006 never that sir he had said
61-70970-0007 he was in deep converse with the clerk and entered the hall holding him by the arm
61-70970-0008 now to bed boy
61-70970-0009 tis late and i go myself within a short space
61-70970-0010 dismiss your squire robin and bid me good e e n
61-70970-0011 as any in england i would say said gamewell proudly that is in his day
61-70970-0012 yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come
61-70970-0013 there was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to gamewell's chamber
61-70970-0014 presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step
61-70970-0015 will cried he softly and stuteley who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber sprang up at once in answer
61-70970-0016 we will go out together to the bower there is a way down to the court from my window
61-70970-0017 rest and be still until i warn you
61-70970-0018 the hours passed wearily by and movement could yet be heard about the hall
61-70970-0019 at last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of gamewell
61-70970-0020 will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready
61-70970-0021 they then renewed their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs
61-70970-0022 robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling esquire after him
61-70970-0023 be not so foolish friend said fitzooth crossly
61-70970-0024 they moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before and about them to find something to show that warrenton had fulfilled his mission
61-70970-0025 they were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuteley had tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit
61-70970-0026 fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of a ladder and slowly the truth came to him
61-70970-0027 robin carefully descended the ladder and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground
61-70970-0028 stuteley was by his side in a flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault
61-70970-0029 from the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrenton's
61-70970-0030 save me masters but you startled me rarely
61-70970-0031 cried he waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him
61-70970-0032 enquired robin with his suspicions still upon him
61-70970-0033 truly such a horse should be worth much in nottingham fair
61-70970-0034 nay nay lording answered warrenton with a half laugh
61-70970-0035 warrenton spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think geoffrey's claims to the estate would be passed by
61-70970-0036 robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warrenton had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them
61-70970-0037 his tones rang pleasantly on warrenton's ears and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them
61-70970-0038 the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gamewell that this passage way led from the hut in the pleasance to sherwood and that geoffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest
61-70970-0039 he implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands
61-70970-0040 they regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell
