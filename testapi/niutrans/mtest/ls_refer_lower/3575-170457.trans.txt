3575-170457-0000 and often has my mother said while on her lap i laid my head she feared for time i was not made but for eternity
3575-170457-0001 why are we to be denied each other's society
3575-170457-0002 why are we to be divided
3575-170457-0003 surely it must be because we are in danger of loving each other too well of losing sight of the creator in idolatry of the creature
3575-170457-0004 we used to dispute about politics and religion
3575-170457-0005 she a tory and clergyman's daughter was always in a minority of one in our house of violent dissent and radicalism
3575-170457-0006 her feeble health gave her her yielding manner for she could never oppose any one without gathering up all her strength for the struggle
3575-170457-0007 he spoke french perfectly i have been told when need was but delighted usually in talking the broadest yorkshire
3575-170457-0008 and so life and death have dispersed the circle of violent radicals and dissenters into which twenty years ago the little quiet resolute clergyman's daughter was received and by whom she was truly loved and honoured
3575-170457-0009 january and february of eighteen thirty seven had passed away and still there was no reply from southey
3575-170457-0010 i am not depreciating it when i say that in these times it is not rare
3575-170457-0011 but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent if you consult your own happiness
3575-170457-0012 you will say that a woman has no need of such a caution there can be no peril in it for her
3575-170457-0013 the more she is engaged in her proper duties the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation
3575-170457-0014 to those duties you have not yet been called and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity
3575-170457-0015 but do not suppose that i disparage the gift which you possess nor that i would discourage you from exercising it i only exhort you so to think of it and so to use it as to render it conducive to your own permanent good
3575-170457-0016 farewell madam
3575-170457-0017 though i may be but an ungracious adviser you will allow me therefore to subscribe myself with the best wishes for your happiness here and hereafter your true friend robert southey
3575-170457-0018 sir march sixteenth
3575-170457-0019 i had not ventured to hope for such a reply so considerate in its tone so noble in its spirit
3575-170457-0020 i know the first letter i wrote to you was all senseless trash from beginning to end but i am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote
3575-170457-0021 i thought it therefore my duty when i left school to become a governess
3575-170457-0022 in the evenings i confess i do think but i never trouble any one else with my thoughts
3575-170457-0023 i carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and eccentricity which might lead those i live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits
3575-170457-0024 i don't always succeed for sometimes when i'm teaching or sewing i would rather be reading or writing but i try to deny myself and my father's approbation amply rewarded me for the privation
3575-170457-0025 again i thank you this incident i suppose will be renewed no more if i live to be an old woman i shall remember it thirty years hence as a bright dream
3575-170457-0026 p s pray sir excuse me for writing to you a second time i could not help writing partly to tell you how thankful i am for your kindness and partly to let you know that your advice shall not be wasted however sorrowfully and reluctantly it may be at first followed c b
3575-170457-0027 i cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting southey's reply
3575-170457-0028 keswick march twenty second eighteen thirty seven dear madam
3575-170457-0029 your letter has given me great pleasure and i should not forgive myself if i did not tell you so
3575-170457-0030 of this second letter also she spoke and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the lakes
3575-170457-0031 on august twenty seventh eighteen thirty seven she writes
3575-170457-0032 come come i am getting really tired of your absence
3575-170457-0033 saturday after saturday comes round and i can have no hope of hearing your knock at the door and then being told that miss e is come oh dear
3575-170457-0034 in this monotonous life of mine that was a pleasant event
3575-170457-0035 i wish it would recur again but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness the estrangement of this long separation will wear away
3575-170457-0036 my eyes fill with tears when i contrast the bliss of such a state brightened by hopes of the future with the melancholy state i now live in uncertain that i ever felt true contrition wandering in thought and deed longing for holiness which i shall never never obtain smitten at times to the heart with the conviction that ghastly calvinistic doctrines are true darkened in short by the very shadows of spiritual death
3575-170457-0037 if christian perfection be necessary to salvation i shall never be saved my heart is a very hotbed for sinful thoughts and when i decide on an action i scarcely remember to look to my redeemer for direction
3575-170457-0038 and meantime i know the greatness of jehovah i acknowledge the perfection of his word i adore the purity of the christian faith my theory is right my practice horribly wrong
3575-170457-0039 the christmas holidays came and she and anne returned to the parsonage and to that happy home circle in which alone their natures expanded amongst all other people they shrivelled up more or less
3575-170457-0040 indeed there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters without producing the same result
3575-170457-0041 she was gone out into the village on some errand when as she was descending the steep street her foot slipped on the ice and she fell it was dark and no one saw her mischance till after a time her groans attracted the attention of a passer by
3575-170457-0042 unfortunately the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning as no surgeon was to be had before that time and she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state
3575-170457-0043 however remembering what you told me namely that you had commended the matter to a higher decision than ours and that you were resolved to submit with resignation to that decision whatever it might be i hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent it may be all for the best
3575-170457-0044 after this disappointment i never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again it seems as if some fatality stood between you and me
3575-170457-0045 i am not good enough for you and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society
3575-170457-0046 a good neighbour of the brontes a clever intelligent yorkshire woman who keeps a druggist's shop in haworth and from her occupation her experience and excellent sense holds the position of village doctress and nurse and as such has been a friend in many a time of trial and sickness and death in the households round told me a characteristic little incident connected with tabby's fractured leg
3575-170457-0047 tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was as charlotte expressed it one of the family
3575-170457-0048 he refused at first to listen to the careful advice it was repugnant to his liberal nature
3575-170457-0049 this decision was communicated to the girls
3575-170457-0050 tabby had tended them in their childhood they and none other should tend her in her infirmity and age
3575-170457-0051 at tea time they were sad and silent and the meal went away untouched by any of the three
3575-170457-0052 she had another weight on her mind this christmas
3575-170457-0053 but anne had begun to suffer just before the holidays and charlotte watched over her younger sisters with the jealous vigilance of some wild creature that changes her very nature if danger threatens her young
3575-170457-0054 stung by anxiety for this little sister she upbraided miss w for her fancied indifference to anne's state of health
3575-170457-0055 still her heart had received a shock in the perception of anne's delicacy and all these holidays she watched over her with the longing fond anxiety which is so full of sudden pangs of fear
3575-170457-0056 i doubt whether branwell was maintaining himself at this time
