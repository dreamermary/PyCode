3570-5695-0000 in a general way though not wholly nor consistently these two groups coincide
3570-5695-0001 the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last
3570-5695-0002 but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone
3570-5695-0003 in the communities of the western culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class
3570-5695-0004 if beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort
3570-5695-0005 the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household's pecuniary decency
3570-5695-0006 very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away
3570-5695-0007 there is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need
3570-5695-0008 the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect
3570-5695-0009 each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth
3570-5695-0010 the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line
3570-5695-0011 it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure
3570-5695-0012 it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest
3570-5695-0013 consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country
3570-5695-0014 among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute
3570-5695-0015 the result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen
