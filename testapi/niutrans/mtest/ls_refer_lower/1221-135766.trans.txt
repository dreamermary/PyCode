1221-135766-0000 how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child
1221-135766-0001 god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonoured bosom to connect her parent for ever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven
1221-135766-0002 yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension
1221-135766-0003 the child had a native grace which does not invariably co exist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best
1221-135766-0004 this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life
1221-135766-0005 hester could only account for the child's character and even then most vaguely and imperfectly by recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth
1221-135766-0006 they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child's disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind
1221-135766-0007 hester prynne nevertheless the loving mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity
1221-135766-0008 mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge
1221-135766-0009 as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment
1221-135766-0010 it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not help questioning at such moments whether pearl was a human child
1221-135766-0011 beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive
1221-135766-0012 brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence
1221-135766-0013 pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world
1221-135766-0014 pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance
1221-135766-0015 if spoken to she would not speak again
