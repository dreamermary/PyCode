1320-122617-0000 notwithstanding the high resolution of hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur
1320-122617-0001 in his return to the camp his acute and practised intellects were intently engaged in devising means to counteract a watchfulness and suspicion on the part of his enemies that he knew were in no degree inferior to his own
1320-122617-0002 in other words while he had implicit faith in the ability of balaam's ass to speak he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bear's singing and yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs
1320-122617-0003 there was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind
1320-122617-0004 the ingenious hawkeye who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation
1320-122617-0005 the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well known voice replied
1320-122617-0006 can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him
1320-122617-0007 come come returned hawkeye uncasing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business
1320-122617-0008 the young man is in bondage and much i fear his death is decreed
1320-122617-0009 i greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance and i have sought a goodly hymn can you lead me to him
1320-122617-0010 the task will not be difficult returned david hesitating though i greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes
1320-122617-0011 the lodge in which uncas was confined was in the very center of the village and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation
1320-122617-0012 four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of uncas wary but close observers of the manner of their captive
1320-122617-0013 delivered in a strong tone of assent announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared
1320-122617-0014 they drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter
1320-122617-0015 but the bear instead of obeying maintained the seat it had taken and growled
1320-122617-0016 the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hint he received they must stand further off
1320-122617-0017 then as if satisfied of their safety the scout left his position and slowly entered the place
1320-122617-0018 it was silent and gloomy being tenanted solely by the captive and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purposed of cookery
1320-122617-0019 uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful withes
1320-122617-0020 the scout who had left david at the door to ascertain they were not observed thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy
1320-122617-0021 what shall we do with the mingoes at the door they count six and this singer is as good as nothing
1320-122617-0022 the delawares are children of the tortoise and they outstrip the deer
1320-122617-0023 uncas who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge
1320-122617-0024 but hawkeye who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement continued speaking more to himself than to his companion
1320-122617-0025 so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed
1320-122617-0026 well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention
1320-122617-0027 as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions
1320-122617-0028 my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettled at so direct an attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits
1320-122617-0029 if you are not then knocked on the head your being a non composser will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed
1320-122617-0030 so choose for yourself to make a rush or tarry here
1320-122617-0031 bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service
1320-122617-0032 keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be
1320-122617-0033 if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends
1320-122617-0034 hold said david perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him i am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge
1320-122617-0035 then heaving a heavy sigh probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned he added it is what i would wish to practise myself as one without a cross of blood though it is not always easy to deal with an indian as you would with a fellow christian
1320-122617-0036 god bless you friend i do believe your scent is not greatly wrong when the matter is duly considered and keeping eternity before the eyes though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation
1320-122617-0037 the delaware dog he said leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features is he afraid
1320-122617-0038 will the hurons hear his groans
1320-122617-0039 the mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort
1320-122617-0040 he had no occasion to delay for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air and ran along the whole extent of the village
1320-122617-0041 uncas cast his skin and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions
