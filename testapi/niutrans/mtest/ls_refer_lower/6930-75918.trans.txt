6930-75918-0000 concord returned to its place amidst the tents
6930-75918-0001 the english forwarded to the french baskets of flowers of which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the young princess the french in return invited the english to a supper which was to be given the next day
6930-75918-0002 congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey
6930-75918-0003 from the respect paid her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared an object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget france
6930-75918-0004 she taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future opened before them
6930-75918-0005 the count had thrown himself back on his seat leaning his shoulders against the partition of the tent and remained thus his face buried in his hands with heaving chest and restless limbs
6930-75918-0006 this has indeed been a harassing day continued the young man his eyes fixed upon his friend
6930-75918-0007 you will be frank with me i always am
6930-75918-0008 can you imagine why buckingham has been so violent i suspect
6930-75918-0009 it is you who are mistaken raoul i have read his distress in his eyes in his every gesture and action the whole day
6930-75918-0010 i can perceive love clearly enough
6930-75918-0011 i am convinced of what i say said the count
6930-75918-0012 it is annoyance then
6930-75918-0013 in those very terms i even added more
6930-75918-0014 but continued raoul not interrupted by this movement of his friend heaven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bear on matters of such high importance
6930-75918-0015 thus it is that the honor of three is saved our country's our master's and our own
6930-75918-0016 yes i need repose many things have agitated me to day both in mind and body when you return to morrow i shall no longer be the same man
6930-75918-0017 but in this friendly pressure raoul could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict
6930-75918-0018 the night was clear starlit and splendid the tempest had passed away and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life peace and security everywhere
6930-75918-0019 upon the large square in front of the hotel the shadows of the tents intersected by the golden moonbeams formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones
6930-75918-0020 bragelonne watched for some time the conduct of the two lovers listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of manicamp who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing his blue and gold instead of his violet suit
