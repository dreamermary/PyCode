1995-1826-0000 in the debate between the senior societies her defence of the fifteenth amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning but delivered with real enthusiasm
1995-1826-0001 the south she had not thought of seriously and yet knowing of its delightful hospitality and mild climate she was not averse to charleston or new orleans
1995-1826-0002 john taylor who had supported her through college was interested in cotton
1995-1826-0003 better go he had counselled sententiously
1995-1826-0004 might learn something useful down there
1995-1826-0005 but john there's no society just elementary work
1995-1826-0006 been looking up tooms county
1995-1826-0007 find some cresswells there big plantations rated at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
1995-1826-0008 some others too big cotton county
1995-1826-0009 you ought to know john if i teach negroes i'll scarcely see much of people in my own class
1995-1826-0010 at any rate i say go
1995-1826-0011 here she was teaching dirty children and the smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable
1995-1826-0012 she wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms
1995-1826-0013 so for the hundredth time she was thinking today as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn and then slowly down through the bottoms
1995-1826-0014 cotton she paused
1995-1826-0015 she had almost forgotten that it was here within touch and sight
1995-1826-0016 the glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her stretching away to the northward
1995-1826-0017 there might be a bit of poetry here and there but most of this place was such desperate prose
1995-1826-0018 her regard shifted to the green stalks and leaves again and she started to move away
1995-1826-0019 cotton is a wonderful thing is it not boys she said rather primly
1995-1826-0020 miss taylor did not know much about cotton but at least one more remark seemed called for
1995-1826-0021 don't know well of all things inwardly commented miss taylor literally born in cotton and oh well as much as to ask what's the use she turned again to go
1995-1826-0022 i suppose though it's too early for them then came the explosion
1995-1826-0023 goobers don't grow on the tops of vines but underground on the roots like yams is that so
1995-1826-0024 the golden fleece it's the silver fleece he harkened
1995-1826-0025 some time you'll tell me please won't you
1995-1826-0026 now for one little half hour she had been a woman talking to a boy no not even that she had been talking just talking there were no persons in the conversation just things one thing cotton
