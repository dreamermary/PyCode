1320-122612-0000 since the period of our tale the active spirit of the country has surrounded it with a belt of rich and thriving settlements though none but the hunter or the savage is ever known even now to penetrate its wild recesses
1320-122612-0001 the dews were suffered to exhale and the sun had dispersed the mists and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest when the travelers resumed their journey
1320-122612-0002 after proceeding a few miles the progress of hawkeye who led the advance became more deliberate and watchful
1320-122612-0003 he often stopped to examine the trees nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity the velocity and the color of its waters
1320-122612-0004 distrusting his own judgment his appeals to the opinion of chingachgook were frequent and earnest
1320-122612-0005 yet here are we within a short range of the scaroons and not a sign of a trail have we crossed
1320-122612-0006 let us retrace our steps and examine as we go with keener eyes
1320-122612-0007 chingachgook had caught the look and motioning with his hand he bade him speak
1320-122612-0008 the eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed
1320-122612-0009 it would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding
1320-122612-0010 see said uncas pointing north and south at the evident marks of the broad trail on either side of him the dark hair has gone toward the forest
1320-122612-0011 if a rock or a rivulet or a bit of earth harder than common severed the links of the clew they followed the true eye of the scout recovered them at a distance and seldom rendered the delay of a single moment necessary
1320-122612-0012 extinguished brands were lying around a spring the offals of a deer were scattered about the place and the trees bore evident marks of having been browsed by the horses
1320-122612-0013 a circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn and each of the party took a segment for his portion
1320-122612-0014 the examination however resulted in no discovery
1320-122612-0015 the whole party crowded to the spot where uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvion
1320-122612-0016 run back uncas and bring me the size of the singer's foot
