3570-5694-0000 but already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system
3570-5694-0001 the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth
3570-5694-0002 such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life
3570-5694-0003 with a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily
3570-5694-0004 in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class
3570-5694-0005 under the tabu certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class
3570-5694-0006 drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence
3570-5694-0007 it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle
3570-5694-0008 the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master
3570-5694-0009 with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters
3570-5694-0010 the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial
3570-5694-0011 the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives
3570-5694-0012 there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades
3570-5694-0013 this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility
3570-5694-0014 many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers
3570-5694-0015 so many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification
3570-5694-0016 many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of less degree have in turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera
3570-5694-0017 the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible
3570-5694-0018 the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble
3570-5694-0019 but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked
3570-5694-0020 so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments
3570-5694-0021 whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character
3570-5694-0022 the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it
