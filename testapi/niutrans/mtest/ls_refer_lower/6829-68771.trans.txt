6829-68771-0000 so to the surprise of the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forbes's aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary
6829-68771-0001 one of mister hopkins's first tasks after calling his faithful henchmen around him was to make a careful canvass of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished
6829-68771-0002 the weak kneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or another secured from the opposition
6829-68771-0003 the democratic committee figured out a way to do this
6829-68771-0004 under ordinary conditions reynolds was sure to be elected but the committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect hopkins
6829-68771-0005 the only thing necessary was to fix seth reynolds and this hopkins arranged personally
6829-68771-0006 and this was why kenneth and beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy
6829-68771-0007 the description she gave of the coming reception to the woman's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were
6829-68771-0008 these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mister forbes
6829-68771-0009 louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their good will that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were enlisted
6829-68771-0010 the fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests
6829-68771-0011 tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served
6829-68771-0012 this was the first occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given at elmhurst and the only one within the memory of man where the neighbors and country people had been invited guests
6829-68771-0013 the attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls were delighted foreseeing great success for their fete
6829-68771-0014 we ought to have more attendants beth said louise approaching her cousin
6829-68771-0015 won't you run into the house and see if martha can't spare one or two more maids
6829-68771-0016 she was very fond of the young ladies whom she had known when aunt jane was the mistress here and beth was her especial favorite
6829-68771-0017 the housekeeper led the way and beth followed
6829-68771-0018 for a moment beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face
6829-68771-0019 she was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at elmhurst a plain black gown with white apron and cap
6829-68771-0020 then she gave a little laugh and replied no miss beth i'm elizabeth parsons
6829-68771-0021 but it can't be protested the girl
6829-68771-0022 i attend to the household mending you know and care for the linen
6829-68771-0023 you speak like an educated person said beth wonderingly where is your home
6829-68771-0024 for the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor
6829-68771-0025 she sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap rocked slowly back and forth i'm sorry said beth
6829-68771-0026 eliza parsons shook her head
6829-68771-0027 they they excite me in some way and i i can't bear them you must excuse me
6829-68771-0028 she even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted
6829-68771-0029 beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact
6829-68771-0030 her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance
6829-68771-0031 her eyes wandered to the maid's hands
6829-68771-0032 however her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story
6829-68771-0033 she rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath
6829-68771-0034 i wish i knew myself she cried fiercely
6829-68771-0035 will you leave me alone in my own room or must i go away to escape you
6829-68771-0036 eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked in the lock
