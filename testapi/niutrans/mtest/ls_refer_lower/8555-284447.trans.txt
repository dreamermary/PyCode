8555-284447-0000 then he rushed down stairs into the courtyard shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions if the sailorman was not recaptured
8555-284447-0001 hold him fast my men and as soon as i've had my coffee and oatmeal i'll take him to the room of the great knife and patch him
8555-284447-0002 i wouldn't mind a cup o coffee myself said cap'n bill i've had consid'ble exercise this mornin and i'm all ready for breakfas
8555-284447-0003 but cap'n bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless
8555-284447-0004 as soon as they entered the room of the great knife the boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment
8555-284447-0005 the room of the great knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon
8555-284447-0006 in one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant throne chairs for the king and queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the snubnosed princesses
8555-284447-0007 therefore her majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her
8555-284447-0008 rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing
8555-284447-0009 mornin girls hope ye feel as well as ye look
8555-284447-0010 control yourselves my dears replied the boolooroo the worst punishment i know how to inflict on anyone this prisoner is about to suffer you'll see a very pretty patching my royal daughters
8555-284447-0011 suppose it's a friend
8555-284447-0012 the captain shook his head
8555-284447-0013 why you said to fetch the first living creature we met and that was this billygoat replied the captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goat's horns
8555-284447-0014 the idea of patching cap'n bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter
8555-284447-0015 they look something alike you know suggested the captain of the guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and they're nearly the same size if you stand the goat on his hind legs they've both got the same style of whiskers and they're both of em obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch splendid
8555-284447-0016 fine glorious
8555-284447-0017 when this had been accomplished the boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before
8555-284447-0018 at once the goat gave a leap escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the boolooroo
8555-284447-0019 before any could stop him he butted his majesty so furiously that the king soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning
8555-284447-0020 the goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack
8555-284447-0021 then they sped in great haste for the door and the goat gave a final butt that sent the row of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within sound of their voices
8555-284447-0022 i had a notion it was you mate as saved me from the knife
8555-284447-0023 i couldn't shiver much bein bound so tight but when i'm loose i mean to have jus one good shiver to relieve my feelin's
8555-284447-0024 come and get the boolooroo she said going toward the benches
