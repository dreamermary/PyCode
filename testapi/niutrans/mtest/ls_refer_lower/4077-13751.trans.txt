4077-13751-0000 on the sixth of april eighteen thirty the church of jesus christ of latter day saints was formally organized and thus took on a legal existence
4077-13751-0001 its origin was small a germ an insignificant seed hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition
4077-13751-0002 instead of but six regularly affiliated members and at most two score of adherents the organization numbers today many hundred thousand souls
4077-13751-0003 in place of a single hamlet in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated there now are about seventy stakes of zion and about seven hundred organized wards each ward and stake with its full complement of officers and priesthood organizations
4077-13751-0004 the practise of gathering its proselytes into one place prevents the building up and strengthening of foreign branches and inasmuch as extensive and strong organizations are seldom met with abroad very erroneous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church
4077-13751-0005 nevertheless the mustard seed among the smallest of all seeds has attained the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorn is now an oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth
4077-13751-0006 their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun not merely that the work of proselyting should be carried on in the west but that the headquarters of the church should be there established
4077-13751-0007 the book of mormon had taught the people the true origin and destiny of the american indians and toward this dark skinned remnant of a once mighty people the missionaries of mormonism early turned their eyes and with their eyes went their hearts and their hopes
4077-13751-0008 it is notable that the indian tribes have generally regarded the religion of the latter day saints with favor seeing in the book of mormon striking agreement with their own traditions
4077-13751-0009 the first well established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of kirtland ohio almost within sight of lake erie and here soon rose the first temple of modern times
4077-13751-0010 to the fervent latter day saint a temple is not simply a church building a house for religious assembly
4077-13751-0011 soon thousands of converts had rented or purchased homes in missouri independence jackson county being their center but from the first they were unpopular among the missourians
4077-13751-0012 the lieutenant governor lilburn w boggs afterward governor was a pronounced mormon hater and throughout the period of the troubles he manifested sympathy with the persecutors
4077-13751-0013 their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe
4077-13751-0014 making their way across the river most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of clay county and afterward established themselves in caldwell county therein founding the city of far west
4077-13751-0015 a small settlement had been founded by mormon families on shoal creek and here on the thirtieth of october eighteen thirty eight a company of two hundred and forty fell upon the hapless settlers and butchered a score
4077-13751-0016 be it said to the honor of some of the officers entrusted with the terrible commission that when they learned its true significance they resigned their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold blooded butchery
4077-13751-0017 oh what a record to read what a picture to gaze upon how awful the fact
4077-13751-0018 american school boys read with emotions of horror of the albigenses driven beaten and killed with a papal legate directing the butchery and of the vaudois hunted and hounded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate
4077-13751-0019 who began the quarrel was it the mormons
4077-13751-0020 as a sample of the press comments against the brutality of the missourians i quote a paragraph from the quincy argus march sixteenth eighteen thirty nine
4077-13751-0021 it will be observed that an organized mob aided by many of the civil and military officers of missouri with governor boggs at their head have been the prominent actors in this business incited too it appears against the mormons by political hatred and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge
