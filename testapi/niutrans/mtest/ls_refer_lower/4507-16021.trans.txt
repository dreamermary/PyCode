4507-16021-0000 chapter one origin
4507-16021-0001 it engenders a whole world la pegre for which read theft and a hell la pegrenne for which read hunger
4507-16021-0002 thus idleness is the mother
4507-16021-0003 she has a son theft and a daughter hunger
4507-16021-0004 what is slang
4507-16021-0005 we have never understood this sort of objections
4507-16021-0006 slang is odious
4507-16021-0007 slang makes one shudder
4507-16021-0008 who denies that of course it does
4507-16021-0009 when it is a question of probing a wound a gulf a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom
4507-16021-0010 we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits
4507-16021-0011 why should one not explore everything and study everything
4507-16021-0012 why should one halt on the way
4507-16021-0013 nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang
4507-16021-0014 now when has horror ever excluded study
4507-16021-0015 since when has malady banished medicine
4507-16021-0016 can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the centipede the tarantula and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is
4507-16021-0017 he would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity
4507-16021-0018 what is slang properly speaking
4507-16021-0019 it is the language of wretchedness
4507-16021-0020 we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be told that all trades professions it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slang
4507-16021-0021 the painter who says my grinder the notary who says my skip the gutter the hairdresser who says my mealyback the cobbler who says my cub talks slang
4507-16021-0022 there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses
4507-16021-0023 the sugar manufacturer who says loaf clarified lumps bastard common burnt this honest manufacturer talks slang
4507-16021-0024 algebra medicine botany have each their slang
4507-16021-0025 to meet the needs of this conflict wretchedness has invented a language of combat which is slang
4507-16021-0026 to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the gulf were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself
4507-16021-0027 phoenician very good
4507-16021-0028 even dialect let that pass
4507-16021-0029 to this we reply in one word only
4507-16021-0030 assuredly if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study
4507-16021-0031 and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy is not a business in which choice is permitted
4507-16021-0032 he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those impenetrable casemates where crawl pell mell those who bleed and those who deal the blow those who weep and those who curse those who fast and those who devour those who endure evil and those who inflict it
4507-16021-0033 do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern
4507-16021-0034 they constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always interlaced and which often bring forth results
4507-16021-0035 true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingles in everything
4507-16021-0036 facts form one of these and ideas the other
4507-16021-0037 there it clothes itself in word masks in metaphor rags
4507-16021-0038 in this guise it becomes horrible
4507-16021-0039 one perceives without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word
4507-16021-0040 one thinks one hears hydras talking
4507-16021-0041 it is unintelligible in the dark
4507-16021-0042 it is black in misfortune it is blacker still in crime these two blacknesses amalgamated compose slang
4507-16021-0043 the earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail
4507-16021-0044 look closely at life
4507-16021-0045 it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment
4507-16021-0046 each day has its own great grief or its little care
4507-16021-0047 yesterday you were trembling for a health that is dear to you to day you fear for your own to morrow it will be anxiety about money the day after to morrow the diatribe of a slanderer the day after that the misfortune of some friend then the prevailing weather then something that has been broken or lost then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral column reproach you again the course of public affairs
4507-16021-0048 this without reckoning in the pains of the heart and so it goes on
4507-16021-0049 there is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny
4507-16021-0050 and you belong to that small class who are happy
4507-16021-0051 in this world evidently the vestibule of another there are no fortunate
4507-16021-0052 the real human division is this the luminous and the shady
4507-16021-0053 to diminish the number of the shady to augment the number of the luminous that is the object
4507-16021-0054 that is why we cry education science
4507-16021-0055 to teach reading means to light the fire every syllable spelled out sparkles
4507-16021-0056 however he who says light does not necessarily say joy
4507-16021-0057 people suffer in the light excess burns
4507-16021-0058 the flame is the enemy of the wing
4507-16021-0059 to burn without ceasing to fly therein lies the marvel of genius
