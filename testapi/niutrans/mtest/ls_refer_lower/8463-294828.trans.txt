8463-294828-0000 chapter three as master wishes
8463-294828-0001 three seconds before the arrival of j b hobson's letter i no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the northwest passage
8463-294828-0002 even so i had just returned from an arduous journey exhausted and badly needing a rest
8463-294828-0003 i wanted nothing more than to see my country again my friends my modest quarters by the botanical gardens my dearly beloved collections
8463-294828-0004 but now nothing could hold me back
8463-294828-0005 conseil was my manservant
8463-294828-0006 from rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the botanical gardens the boy had come to know a thing or two
8463-294828-0007 classifying was everything to him so he knew nothing else well versed in the theory of classification he was poorly versed in its practical application and i doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale
8463-294828-0008 and yet what a fine gallant lad
8463-294828-0009 not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of a journey
8463-294828-0010 never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever china or the congo no matter how far off it was
8463-294828-0011 he went here there and everywhere in perfect contentment
8463-294828-0012 please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting i had turned forty
8463-294828-0013 he was a fanatic on formality and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got tiresome
8463-294828-0014 there was good reason to stop and think even for the world's most emotionless man
8463-294828-0015 conseil i called a third time conseil appeared
8463-294828-0016 did master summon me he said entering
8463-294828-0017 pack as much into my trunk as you can my traveling kit my suits shirts and socks don't bother counting just squeeze it all in and hurry
8463-294828-0018 we'll deal with them later what
8463-294828-0019 anyhow we'll leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to france
8463-294828-0020 yes we are certainly i replied evasively but after we make a detour
8463-294828-0021 a route slightly less direct that's all
8463-294828-0022 we're leaving on the abraham lincoln
8463-294828-0023 you see my friend it's an issue of the monster the notorious narwhale
8463-294828-0024 we don't know where it will take us
8463-294828-0025 but we're going just the same
8463-294828-0026 we have a commander who's game for anything
8463-294828-0027 i left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to paris france
8463-294828-0028 i opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and conseil at my heels i jumped into a carriage
8463-294828-0029 our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate i rushed aboard
8463-294828-0030 i asked for commander farragut
8463-294828-0031 one of the sailors led me to the afterdeck where i stood in the presence of a smart looking officer who extended his hand to me
8463-294828-0032 in person welcome aboard professor your cabin is waiting for you
8463-294828-0033 i was well satisfied with my cabin which was located in the stern and opened into the officers mess
8463-294828-0034 we'll be quite comfortable here i told conseil
8463-294828-0035 and so if i'd been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less the frigate would have gone without me and i would have missed out on this unearthly extraordinary and inconceivable expedition whose true story might well meet with some skepticism
8463-294828-0036 the wharves of brooklyn and every part of new york bordering the east river were crowded with curiosity seekers
8463-294828-0037 departing from five hundred thousand throats three cheers burst forth in succession
8463-294828-0038 thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses hailing the abraham lincoln until it reached the waters of the hudson river at the tip of the long peninsula that forms new york city
