4446-2275-0000 the stop at queenstown the tedious passage up the mersey were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience
4446-2275-0001 she blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs
4446-2275-0002 alexander paced up and down the hallway buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat until she returned and took him up to hilda's living room
4446-2275-0003 the room was empty when he entered
4446-2275-0004 alexander did not sit down
4446-2275-0005 i felt it in my bones when i woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up
4446-2275-0006 i thought it might be sister kate or cousin mike would be happening along
4446-2275-0007 she pushed him toward the big chair by the fire and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth her knees drawn up to her chin laughing like a happy little girl
4446-2275-0008 when did you come bartley and how did it happen you haven't spoken a word
4446-2275-0009 i got in about ten minutes ago
4446-2275-0010 alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze
4446-2275-0011 bartley bent lower over the fire
4446-2275-0012 she looked at his heavy shoulders and big determined head thrust forward like a catapult in leash
4446-2275-0013 i'll do anything you wish me to bartley she said tremulously
4446-2275-0014 i can't stand seeing you miserable
4446-2275-0015 he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
4446-2275-0016 hilda watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes it
4446-2275-0017 but it's worse now it's unbearable
4446-2275-0018 i get nothing but misery out of either
4446-2275-0019 the world is all there just as it used to be but i can't get at it any more
4446-2275-0020 it was myself i was defying hilda
4446-2275-0021 hilda's face quivered but she whispered yes i think it must have been
4446-2275-0022 but why didn't you tell me when you were here in the summer
4446-2275-0023 alexander groaned i meant to but somehow i couldn't
4446-2275-0024 she pressed his hand gently in gratitude
4446-2275-0025 weren't you happy then at all
4446-2275-0026 she closed her eyes and took a deep breath as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days
4446-2275-0027 he moved uneasily and his chair creaked
4446-2275-0028 yes yes she hurried pulling her hand gently away from him
4446-2275-0029 please tell me one thing bartley at least tell me that you believe i thought i was making you happy
4446-2275-0030 yes hilda i know that he said simply
4446-2275-0031 i understand bartley i was wrong
4446-2275-0032 but i didn't know you've only to tell me now
4446-2275-0033 what i mean is that i want you to promise never to see me again no matter how often i come no matter how hard i beg
4446-2275-0034 keep away if you wish when have i ever followed you
4446-2275-0035 alexander rose and shook himself angrily yes i know i'm cowardly
4446-2275-0036 he took her roughly in his arms do you know what i mean
4446-2275-0037 oh bartley what am i to do
4446-2275-0038 i will ask the least imaginable but i must have something
4446-2275-0039 i must know about you
4446-2275-0040 the sight of you bartley to see you living and happy and successful can i never make you understand what that means to me
4446-2275-0041 you see loving some one as i love you makes the whole world different
4446-2275-0042 and then you came back not caring very much but it made no difference
4446-2275-0043 bartley bent over and took her in his arms kissing her mouth and her wet tired eyes
4446-2275-0044 don't cry don't cry he whispered
4446-2275-0045 we've tortured each other enough for tonight
