61-70968-0000 he began a confused complaint against the wizard who had 
    vanished behind the curtain on the left
61-70968-0001 give not so earnest a mind to these mummeries child
61-70968-0002 a golden fortune and a happy life
61-70968-0003 he was like unto my father in a way and yet was not my father
61-70968-0004 also there was a stripling page who turned into a maid
61-70968-0005 this was so sweet a lady sir and in some manner 
    i do think she died
61-70968-0006 but then the picture was gone as quickly as it came
61-70968-0007 sister nell do you hear these marvels
61-70968-0008 take your place and let us see what the crystal can 
    show to you
61-70968-0009 like as not young master though i am an old man
61-70968-0010 forthwith all ran to the opening of the tent to see 
    what might be amiss but master will who peeped out first needed no more 
    than one glance
61-70968-0011 he gave way to the others very readily and retreated 
    unperceived by the squire and mistress fitzooth to the rear of the tent
61-70968-0012 cries of a nottingham a nottingham
61-70968-0013 before them fled the stroller and his three sons capless 
    and terrified
61-70968-0014 what is the tumult and rioting cried out the squire 
    authoritatively and he blew twice on a silver whistle which hung 
    at his belt
61-70968-0015 nay we refused their request most politely most noble said 
    the little stroller
61-70968-0016 and then they became vexed and would have snatched your 
    purse from us
61-70968-0017 i could not see my boy injured excellence for but doing 
    his duty as one of cumberland's sons
61-70968-0018 so i did push this fellow
61-70968-0019 it is enough said george gamewell sharply and he turned upon 
    the crowd
61-70968-0020 shame on you citizens cried he i blush for my fellows of nottingham
61-70968-0021 surely we can submit with good grace
61-70968-0022 tis fine for you to talk old man answered the lean sullen apprentice
61-70968-0023 but i wrestled with this fellow and do know that he played unfairly in the second bout
61-70968-0024 spoke the squire losing all patience and it was to you that i gave another purse in consolation
61-70968-0025 come to me men here here he raised his voice still louder
61-70968-0026 the strollers took their part in it with hearty zest now that they had some chance of beating off their foes
61-70968-0027 robin and the little tumbler between them tried to force the squire to stand back and very valiantly did these two comport themselves
61-70968-0028 the head and chief of the riot the nottingham apprentice with clenched fists threatened montfichet
61-70968-0029 the squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself
61-70968-0030 now be silent on your lives he began but the captured apprentice set up an instant shout
61-70968-0031 silence you knave cried montfichet
61-70968-0032 he felt for and found the wizard's black cloth the squire was quite out of breath
61-70968-0033 thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout
61-70968-0034 a montfichet a montfichet gamewell to the rescue
61-70968-0035 taking advantage of this the squire's few men redoubled their efforts and encouraged by robin's and the little stroller's cries fought their way to him
61-70968-0036 george montfichet will never forget this day
61-70968-0037 what is your name lording asked the little stroller presently
61-70968-0038 robin fitzooth
61-70968-0039 and mine is will stuteley shall we be comrades
61-70968-0040 right willingly for between us we have won the battle answered robin
61-70968-0041 i like you will you are the second will that i have met and liked within two days is there a sign in that
61-70968-0042 montfichet called out for robin to give him an arm
61-70968-0043 friends said montfichet faintly to the wrestlers bear us escort so far as the sheriff's house
61-70968-0044 it will not be safe for you to stay here now
61-70968-0045 pray follow us with mine and my lord sheriff's men
61-70968-0046 nottingham castle was reached and admittance was demanded
61-70968-0047 master monceux the sheriff of nottingham was mightily put about when told of the rioting
61-70968-0048 and henry might return to england at any moment
61-70968-0049 have your will child if the boy also wills it montfichet answered feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then
61-70968-0050 he made an effort to hide his condition from them all and robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm
61-70968-0051 beg me a room of the sheriff child quickly
61-70968-0052 but who is this fellow plucking at your sleeve
61-70968-0053 he is my esquire excellency returned robin with dignity
61-70968-0054 mistress fitzooth had been carried off by the sheriff's daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house so that robin alone had the care of montfichet
61-70968-0055 robin was glad when at length they were left to their own devices
61-70968-0056 the wine did certainly bring back the color to the squire's cheeks
61-70968-0057 these escapades are not for old gamewell lad his day has come to twilight
61-70968-0058 will you forgive me now
61-70968-0059 it will be no disappointment to me
61-70968-0060 no thanks i am glad to give you such easy happiness
61-70968-0061 you are a worthy leech will presently whispered robin the wine has worked a marvel
61-70968-0062 ay and show you some pretty tricks
