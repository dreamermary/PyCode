8555-284449-0000 so they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl queen and in a short time the blasts of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of cymbals told trot and cap'n bill that the blue bands had assembled before the palace
8555-284449-0001 then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the army of pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them
8555-284449-0002 at the head of the pinkies were ghip ghisizzle and button bright who had the parrot on his shoulder and they were supported by captain coralie and captain tintint and rosalie the witch
8555-284449-0003 when the blueskins saw ghip ghisizzle they raised another great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people
8555-284449-0004 since last thursday i ghip ghisizzle have been the lawful boolooroo of the blue country but now that you are conquered by queen trot i suppose i am conquered too and you have no boolooroo at all
8555-284449-0005 when he finished she said cheerfully
8555-284449-0006 don't worry sizzle dear it'll all come right pretty soon
8555-284449-0007 now then let's enter the city an enjoy the grand feast that's being cooked i'm nearly starved myself for this conquerin kingdoms is hard work
8555-284449-0008 then she gave rosalie back her magic ring thanking the kind witch for all she had done for them
8555-284449-0009 you are mate replied the sailor
8555-284449-0010 it will be such a satisfaction
8555-284449-0011 the guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the boolooroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the goat before queen trot who awaited them in the throne room of the palace
8555-284449-0012 i'll gladly do that promised the new boolooroo and i'll feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat besides the grass
8555-284449-0013 scuse me said trot i neglected to tell you that you're not the boolooroo any more
8555-284449-0014 the former boolooroo groaned
8555-284449-0015 i'll not be wicked any more sighed the old boolooroo i'll reform
8555-284449-0016 as a private citizen i shall be a model of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise
8555-284449-0017 when first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person in all the blue country who loved the princesses the least little bit
8555-284449-0018 so ghip ghisizzle ordered the captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home
8555-284449-0019 that evening trot gave a grand ball in the palace to which the most important of the pinkies and the blueskins were invited
8555-284449-0020 the combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served
