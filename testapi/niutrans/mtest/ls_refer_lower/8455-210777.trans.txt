8455-210777-0000 i remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light
8455-210777-0001 had eva crasweller not been good looking had jack been still at college had sir kennington oval remained in england had mister bunnit and the bar keeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend
8455-210777-0002 on arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company
8455-210777-0003 as i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self
8455-210777-0004 i have come to your shores mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world
8455-210777-0005 we have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water
8455-210777-0006 we are quite satisfied now captain battleax said my wife
8455-210777-0007 quite satisfied said eva
8455-210777-0008 the ladies in compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other
8455-210777-0009 no doubt in process of time the ladies will follow
8455-210777-0010 their masters said missus neverbend
8455-210777-0011 i did not mean said captain battleax to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this
8455-210777-0012 missus neverbend you must indeed be proud of your son
8455-210777-0013 jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises
8455-210777-0014 sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife
8455-210777-0015 i and my wife and son and the two craswellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next
8455-210777-0016 this i felt was paid to me as being president of the republic and i endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life
8455-210777-0017 my wife on the spur of the moment managed to give the gentlemen a very good dinner
8455-210777-0018 this she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with her
8455-210777-0019 then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies
8455-210777-0020 oh yes said jack and i'm nowhere
8455-210777-0021 but i mean to have my innings before long
8455-210777-0022 of what missus neverbend had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success
8455-210777-0023 we sat with the officers some little time after dinner and then went ashore
8455-210777-0024 how much of evil of real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days
8455-210777-0025 what could i do now but just lay myself down and die
8455-210777-0026 and the death of which i dreamt could not alas
8455-210777-0027 when this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the farthest side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days
8455-210777-0028 jack would become eva's happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world
8455-210777-0029 thinking of all this i went to sleep
8455-210777-0030 mister neverbend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president it cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission
8455-210777-0031 you have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in england stands so high
8455-210777-0032 it is a duty said i
8455-210777-0033 but your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it
8455-210777-0034 not a doubt but had your force been only double or treble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you
8455-210777-0035 that is all quite true mister neverbend said sir ferdinando brown
8455-210777-0036 i can afford to smile because i am absolutely powerless before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter in which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force
8455-210777-0037 you have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction
8455-210777-0038 therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally
8455-210777-0039 i can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board
8455-210777-0040 then said sir ferdinando there is nothing for it but that he must take you with him
8455-210777-0041 there came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt
8455-210777-0042 you hear what sir ferdinando brown has said replied captain battleax
8455-210777-0043 but what is the delicate mission i asked
8455-210777-0044 i was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage it mattered not which
8455-210777-0045 then the republic of britannula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers
8455-210777-0046 you may be quite sure it's there said captain battleax and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board
8455-210777-0047 you propose to kidnap me i said
8455-210777-0048 what would become of your gun were i to kidnap you
8455-210777-0049 lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant officer
8455-210777-0050 one of us always remains on board while the other is on shore
8455-210777-0051 what world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centred itself on sir ferdinando
8455-210777-0052 you will allow me to suggest said he that that is a matter of opinion
8455-210777-0053 were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter
8455-210777-0054 the letter ran as follows
8455-210777-0055 sir i have it in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britannula
8455-210777-0056 the peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellency's knowledge
8455-210777-0057 but in their selection of a constitution the britannulists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberative assembly and hence have sprung their present difficulties
8455-210777-0058 it is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work
8455-210777-0059 but it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your government
8455-210777-0060 the john bright is armed with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britannula should prevail
8455-210777-0061 you will carry out with you one hundred men of the north north west birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if mister neverbend be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience
8455-210777-0062 when do you intend that the john bright shall start
8455-210777-0063 to day i shouted
8455-210777-0064 and i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archives of the government
8455-210777-0065 i shall be happy to take charge of them said sir ferdinando
8455-210777-0066 they of course must all be altered
8455-210777-0067 or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible
8455-210777-0068 your power is sufficient i said
8455-210777-0069 if you will give us your promise to meet captain battleax here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours
8455-210777-0070 and this plan was adopted too in order to extract from me a promise that i would depart in peace
