5683-32865-0000 you know captain lake
5683-32865-0001 said lord chelford addressing me
5683-32865-0002 he had his hand upon lake's shoulder
5683-32865-0003 they are cousins you know we are all cousins
5683-32865-0004 whatever lord chelford said miss brandon received it very graciously and even with a momentary smile
5683-32865-0005 but her greeting to captain lake was more than usually haughty and frozen and her features i fancied particularly proud and pale
5683-32865-0006 at dinner lake was easy and amusing
5683-32865-0007 i'm glad you like it says wylder chuckling benignantly on it over his shoulder
5683-32865-0008 i believe i have a little taste that way those are all real you know those jewels
5683-32865-0009 and he placed it in that gentleman's fingers who now took his turn at the lamp and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement
5683-32865-0010 i was thinking it's very like the ace of hearts answered the captain softly smiling on
5683-32865-0011 whereupon lake laughed quietly still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes
5683-32865-0012 and wylder laughed too more suddenly and noisily than the humour of the joke seemed quite to call for and glanced a grim look from the corners of his eyes on lake but the gallant captain did not seem to perceive it and after a few seconds more he handed it very innocently back to missus dorothy only remarking
5683-32865-0013 do you know lake oh i really can't tell but he'll soon tire of country life
5683-32865-0014 he's not a man for country quarters
5683-32865-0015 i had a horrid dream about him last night that
5683-32865-0016 oh i know that's lorne brandon
5683-32865-0017 all the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following lake
