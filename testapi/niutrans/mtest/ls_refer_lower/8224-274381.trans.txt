8224-274381-0000 though thrown into prison for this enterprise and detained some time he was not discouraged but still continued by his countenance and protection to infuse spirit into the distressed royalists
8224-274381-0001 among other persons of distinction who united themselves to him was lord napier of merchiston son of the famous inventor of the logarithms the person to whom the title of a great man is more justly due than to any other whom his country ever produced
8224-274381-0002 while the former foretold that the scottish covenanters were secretly forming a union with the english parliament and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous undertaking the latter still insisted that every such attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined
8224-274381-0003 the king's ears were now open to montrose's counsels who proposed none but the boldest and most daring agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in scotland
8224-274381-0004 five hundred men more who had been levied by the covenanters were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord elcho who lay at perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the irish invasion
8224-274381-0005 dreading the superior power of argyle who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northwards in order to rouse again the marquis of huntley and the gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covenanters
8224-274381-0006 this nobleman's character though celebrated for political courage and conduct was very low for military prowess and after some skirmishes in which he was worsted he here allowed montrose to escape him
8224-274381-0007 by quick marches through these inaccessible mountains that general freed himself from the superior forces of the covenanters
8224-274381-0008 with these and some reenforcements of the atholemen and macdonalds whom he had recalled montrose fell suddenly upon argyle's country and let loose upon it all the rage of war carrying off the cattle burning the houses and putting the inhabitants to the sword
8224-274381-0009 this severity by which montrose sullied his victories was the result of private animosity against the chieftain as much as of zeal for the public cause argyle collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at innerlochy supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them
8224-274381-0010 by a quick and unexpected march montrose hastened to innerlochy and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not affrightened covenanters
8224-274381-0011 his conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous
8224-274381-0012 montrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces though with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists
8224-274381-0013 from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independents could rely on
8224-274381-0014 besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and unwarily facilitated the project of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction
8224-274381-0015 though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced and rigorously executed by these new commanders
8224-274381-0016 valor indeed was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the other during this period discipline also was attained by the forces of the parliament but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field seems still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting
8224-274381-0017 historians at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience have not remarked any thing but a headlong impetuous conduct each party hurrying to a battle where valor and fortune chiefly determined the success
