672-122797-0000 out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree
672-122797-0001 the place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs
672-122797-0002 he did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries
672-122797-0003 but this was what the tree could not bear to hear
672-122797-0004 in winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree
672-122797-0005 oh that made him so angry
672-122797-0006 to grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world
672-122797-0007 in autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees
672-122797-0008 this happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognised and then they were laid in carts and the horses dragged them out of the wood
672-122797-0009 have you not met them anywhere
672-122797-0010 rejoice in thy growth said the sunbeams
672-122797-0011 and then what happens then
672-122797-0012 i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing
672-122797-0013 i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh
672-122797-0014 were i but already on the cart
672-122797-0015 were i in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence
672-122797-0016 yes then something better something still grander will surely follow or wherefore should they thus ornament me
672-122797-0017 something better something still grander must follow but what
672-122797-0018 rejoice in our presence said the air and the sunlight
672-122797-0019 rejoice in thy own fresh youth
672-122797-0020 but the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer
672-122797-0021 and towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down
672-122797-0022 the axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pang it was like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up
672-122797-0023 he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him anymore perhaps not even the birds
672-122797-0024 the departure was not at all agreeable
672-122797-0025 the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court yard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others
672-122797-0026 there too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so
672-122797-0027 the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it
672-122797-0028 this evening they all said
672-122797-0029 how it will shine this evening
672-122797-0030 perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me
672-122797-0031 it blazed up famously help help
672-122797-0032 cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire
672-122797-0033 a story
672-122797-0034 a story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree
672-122797-0035 but i shall tell only one story
672-122797-0036 humpy dumpy fell downstairs and yet he married the princess
672-122797-0037 that's the way of the world
672-122797-0038 thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well
672-122797-0039 i won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree
672-122797-0040 and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought
672-122797-0041 in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in
672-122797-0042 but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him
672-122797-0043 what's the meaning of this thought the tree
672-122797-0044 and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie
672-122797-0045 time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way
672-122797-0046 tis now winter out of doors thought the tree
672-122797-0047 how kind man is after all
672-122797-0048 if it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely
672-122797-0049 squeak squeak
672-122797-0050 they snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches
672-122797-0051 i am by no means old said the fir tree
672-122797-0052 there's many a one considerably older than i am
672-122797-0053 they were so extremely curious
672-122797-0054 i know no such place said the tree
672-122797-0055 and then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said
672-122797-0056 said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related
672-122797-0057 yes in reality those were happy times
672-122797-0058 who is humpy dumpy asked the mice
672-122797-0059 only that one answered the tree
672-122797-0060 it is a very stupid story
672-122797-0061 don't you know one about bacon and tallow candles can't you tell any larder stories
672-122797-0062 no said the tree
672-122797-0063 then good bye said the rats and they went home
672-122797-0064 at last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what i told them
672-122797-0065 now that too is over
672-122797-0066 why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft
672-122797-0067 the trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone
672-122797-0068 but it was not the fir tree that they meant
672-122797-0069 it was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles
672-122797-0070 the golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine
672-122797-0071 in the court yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him
672-122797-0072 and the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there
672-122797-0073 the wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and it sighed so deeply
672-122797-0074 however that was over now the tree gone the story at an end
