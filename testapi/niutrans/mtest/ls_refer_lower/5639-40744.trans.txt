5639-40744-0000 eleven o'clock had struck it was a fine clear night they were the only persons on the road and they sauntered leisurely along to avoid paying the price of fatigue for the recreation provided for the toledans in their valley or on the banks of their river
5639-40744-0001 secure as he thought in the careful administration of justice in that city and the character of its well disposed inhabitants the good hidalgo was far from thinking that any disaster could befal his family
5639-40744-0002 rodolfo and his companions with their faces muffled in their cloaks stared rudely and insolently at the mother the daughter and the servant maid
5639-40744-0003 in a moment he communicated his thoughts to his companions and in the next moment they resolved to turn back and carry her off to please rodolfo for the rich who are open handed always find parasites ready to encourage their bad propensities and thus to conceive this wicked design to communicate it approve it resolve on ravishing leocadia and to carry that design into effect was the work of a moment
5639-40744-0004 they drew their swords hid their faces in the flaps of their cloaks turned back and soon came in front of the little party who had not yet done giving thanks to god for their escape from those audacious men
5639-40744-0005 finally the one party went off exulting and the other was left in desolation and woe
5639-40744-0006 rodolfo arrived at his own house without any impediment and leocadia's parents reached theirs heart broken and despairing
5639-40744-0007 meanwhile rodolfo had leocadia safe in his custody and in his own apartment
5639-40744-0008 who touches me am i in bed
5639-40744-0009 mother dear father do you hear me
5639-40744-0010 it is the only amends i ask of you for the wrong you have done me
5639-40744-0011 she found the door but it was locked outside
5639-40744-0012 she succeeded in opening the window and the moonlight shone in so brightly that she could distinguish the colour of some damask hangings in the room
5639-40744-0013 she saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed that of a prince rather than of a private gentleman
5639-40744-0014 among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window
5639-40744-0015 this person was rodolfo who though he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect not thinking it advisable to acquaint them with what had passed between him and the girl
5639-40744-0016 on the contrary he resolved to tell them that repenting of his violence and moved by her tears he had only carried her half way towards his house and then let her go
5639-40744-0017 choking with emotion leocadi made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them
5639-40744-0018 that would be very well my child replied her father if your plan were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning but no doubt this image has been already missed by its owner and he will have set it down for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there
5639-40744-0019 what you had best do my child is to keep it and pray to it that since it was a witness to your undoing it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment
5639-40744-0020 thus did this humane and right minded father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother embracing her again did all she could to soothe her feelings
5639-40744-0021 she meanwhile passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement never letting herself be seen but shunning every eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face
5639-40744-0022 time rolled on the hour of her delivery arrived it took place in the utmost secrecy her mother taking upon her the office of midwife and she gave birth to a son one of the most beautiful ever seen
5639-40744-0023 when the boy walked through the streets blessings were showered upon him by all who saw him blessings upon his beauty upon the mother that bore him upon the father that begot him upon those who brought him up so well
5639-40744-0024 one day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen
5639-40744-0025 the bed she too well remembered was there and above all the cabinet on which had stood the image she had taken away was still on the same spot
5639-40744-0026 luis was out of danger in a fortnight in a month he rose from his bed and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child
5639-40744-0027 thus saying and pressing the crucifix to her breast she fell fainting into the arms of dona estafania who as a gentlewoman to whose sex pity is as natural as cruelty is to man instantly pressed her lips to those of the fainting girl shedding over her so many tears that there needed no other sprinkling of water to recover leocadia from her swoon
5639-40744-0028 i have great things to tell you senor said dona estafania to her husband the cream and substance of which is this the fainting girl before you is your daughter and that boy is your grandson
5639-40744-0029 this truth which i have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face in which we have both beheld that of our son
5639-40744-0030 just then leocadia came to herself and embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears and the gentleman remained in utter bewilderment until his wife had repeated to him from beginning to end leocadia's whole story and he believed it through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies
5639-40744-0031 so persuasive were her entreaties and so strong her assurances that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she sought they were induced to confess that one summer's night the same she had mentioned themselves and another friend being out on a stroll with rodolfo they had been concerned in the abduction of a girl whom rodolfo carried off whilst the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry and would have defended her if they could
5639-40744-0032 for god's sake my lady mother give me a wife who would be an agreeable companion not one who will disgust me so that we may both bear evenly and with mutual good will the yoke imposed on us by heaven instead of pulling this way and that way and fretting each other to death
5639-40744-0033 her bearing was graceful and animated she led her son by the hand and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks
5639-40744-0034 all rose to do her reverence as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them but gazing on her entranced with admiration not one of them was able to address a single word to her
5639-40744-0035 she reflected how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever and racked by the intensity of her emotions she suddenly changed colour her head dropped and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismayed estafania
5639-40744-0036 his mother had left her to him as being her destined protector but when she saw that he too was insensible she was near making a third and would have done so had he not come to himself
5639-40744-0037 know then son of my heart that this fainting lady is your real bride i say real because she is the one whom your father and i have chosen for you and the portrait was a pretence
5639-40744-0038 just at the moment when the tears of the pitying beholders flowed fastest and their ejaculations were most expressive of despair leocadia gave signs of recovery and brought back gladness to the hearts of all
5639-40744-0039 when she came to her senses and blushing to find herself in rodolfo's arms would have disengaged herself no senora he said that must not be strive not to withdraw from the arms of him who holds you in his soul
5639-40744-0040 this was done for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage without any of the preliminary formalities which are now so properly required
5639-40744-0041 nor was rodolfo less surprised than they and the better to assure himself of so wonderful a fact he begged leocadia to give him some token which should make perfectly clear to him that which indeed he did not doubt since it was authenticated by his parents
