237-134500-0000 frank read english slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
237-134500-0001 marie sighed
237-134500-0002 a brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
237-134500-0003 the orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
237-134500-0004 that invitation decided her
237-134500-0005 oh but i'm glad to get this place mowed
237-134500-0006 just smell the wild roses they are always so spicy after a rain
237-134500-0007 we never had so many of them in here before
237-134500-0008 i suppose it's the wet season will you have to cut them too
237-134500-0009 i suppose that's the wet season too then
237-134500-0010 it's exciting to see everything growing so fast and to get the grass cut
237-134500-0011 aren't you splashed look at the spider webs all over the grass
237-134500-0012 in a few moments he heard the cherries dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his scythe with that long even stroke that few american boys ever learn
237-134500-0013 marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught a shower of raindrops on her neck and hair
237-134500-0014 and emil mowed his way slowly down toward the cherry trees
237-134500-0015 that summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilderness
237-134500-0016 i don't know all of them but i know lindens are
237-134500-0017 if i feel that way i feel that way
237-134500-0018 he reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruit long ivory colored berries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
237-134500-0019 he dropped a handful into her lap
237-134500-0020 yes don't you
237-134500-0021 oh ever so much only he seems kind of staid and school teachery
237-134500-0022 when she used to tell me about him i always wondered whether she wasn't a little in love with him
237-134500-0023 it would serve you all right if she walked off with carl
237-134500-0024 i like to talk to carl about new york and what a fellow can do there
237-134500-0025 oh emil
237-134500-0026 surely you are not thinking of going off there
237-134500-0027 marie's face fell under his brooding gaze
237-134500-0028 i'm sure alexandra hopes you will stay on here she murmured
237-134500-0029 i don't want to stand around and look on
237-134500-0030 i want to be doing something on my own account
237-134500-0031 sometimes i don't want to do anything at all and sometimes i want to pull the four corners of the divide together he threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerk so like a table cloth
237-134500-0032 i get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down
237-134500-0033 i wish you weren't so restless and didn't get so worked up over things she said sadly
237-134500-0034 thank you he returned shortly
237-134500-0035 and you never used to be cross to me
237-134500-0036 i can't play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly that's what you miss marie
237-134500-0037 but emil if i understand then all our good times are over we can never do nice things together any more
237-134500-0038 and anyhow there's nothing to understand
237-134500-0039 that won't last it will go away and things will be just as they used to
237-134500-0040 i pray for you but that's not the same as if you prayed yourself
237-134500-0041 i can't pray to have the things i want he said slowly and i won't pray not to have them not if i'm damned for it
237-134500-0042 then all our good times are over
