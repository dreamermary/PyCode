5142-33396-0000 at another time harald asked
5142-33396-0001 what is your country olaf have you always been a thrall the thrall's eyes flashed
5142-33396-0002 two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle
5142-33396-0003 the rest of you off a viking he had three ships
5142-33396-0004 these he gave to three of my brothers
5142-33396-0005 but i stayed that spring and built me a boat
5142-33396-0006 i made her for only twenty oars because i thought few men would follow me for i was young fifteen years old
5142-33396-0007 at the prow i carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out
5142-33396-0008 i painted the eyes red for anger
5142-33396-0009 there stand so i said and glare and hiss at my foes
5142-33396-0010 in the stern i curved the tail up almost as high as the head
5142-33396-0011 there she sat on the rollers as fair a ship as i ever saw
5142-33396-0012 then i will get me a farm and will winter in that land now who will follow me
5142-33396-0013 he is but a boy the men said
5142-33396-0014 thirty men one after another raised their horns and said
5142-33396-0015 as our boat flashed down the rollers into the water i made this song and sang it
5142-33396-0016 so we harried the coast of norway
5142-33396-0017 we ate at many men's tables uninvited
5142-33396-0018 my dragon's belly is never full and on board went the gold
5142-33396-0019 oh it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals
5142-33396-0020 a house smells of smoke a ship smells of frolic
5142-33396-0021 up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic
5142-33396-0022 what of the farm olaf not yet i answered viking is better for summer
5142-33396-0023 it was so dark that i could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth
5142-33396-0024 i stood with my back to the wall for i wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me
5142-33396-0025 come come i called when no one obeyed a fire
5142-33396-0026 my men laughed yes a stingy host
5142-33396-0027 he acts as though he had not expected us
5142-33396-0028 on a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together
5142-33396-0029 bring in the table we are hungry
5142-33396-0030 the thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat
5142-33396-0031 they set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it and we sat and watched it boil while we joked at last the supper began
5142-33396-0032 the farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat and you cannot wonder for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket loads of bread into our big mouths
5142-33396-0033 you would not eat with us you cannot say no to half of my ale i drink this to your health
5142-33396-0034 then i drank half of the hornful and sent the rest across the fire to the farmer he took it and smiled saying
5142-33396-0035 did you ever have such a lordly guest before i went on
5142-33396-0036 so i will give out this law that my men shall never leave you alone
5142-33396-0037 hakon there shall be your constant companion friend farmer
5142-33396-0038 he shall not leave you day or night whether you are working or playing or sleeping
5142-33396-0039 i named nine others and said
5142-33396-0040 and these shall follow your thralls in the same way
5142-33396-0041 so i set guards over every one in that house
5142-33396-0042 so no tales got out to the neighbors besides it was a lonely place and by good luck no one came that way
5142-33396-0043 their eyes danced big thorleif stood up and stretched himself
5142-33396-0044 i am stiff with long sitting he said i itch for a fight i turned to the farmer
5142-33396-0045 this is our last feast with you i said
5142-33396-0046 by the beard of odin i cried you have taken our joke like a man
5142-33396-0047 my men pounded the table with their fists
5142-33396-0048 by the hammer of thor shouted grim here is no stingy coward
5142-33396-0049 here friend take it and he thrust it into the farmer's hand
5142-33396-0050 may you drink heart's ease from it for many years
5142-33396-0051 and with it i leave you a name sif the friendly i shall hope to drink with you sometime in valhalla
5142-33396-0052 here is a ring for sif the friendly and here is a bracelet a sword would not be ashamed to hang at your side
5142-33396-0053 i took five great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave them to him
5142-33396-0054 that is the best way to decide for the spear will always point somewhere and one thing is as good as another
5142-33396-0055 that time it pointed us into your father's ships
5142-33396-0056 here they said is a rascal who has been harrying our coasts
5142-33396-0057 we sunk his ship and men but him we brought to you
5142-33396-0058 a robber viking said the king and scowled at me
5142-33396-0059 yes and with all your fingers it took you a year to catch me the king frowned more angrily
5142-33396-0060 take him out thorkel and let him taste your sword
5142-33396-0061 your mother the queen was standing by
5142-33396-0062 now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said
5142-33396-0063 and would he not be a good gift for our baby
5142-33396-0064 your father thought a moment then looked at your mother and smiled
5142-33396-0065 soft heart he said gently to her then to thorkel well let him go thorkel
5142-33396-0066 then he turned to me again frowning
5142-33396-0067 but young sharp tongue now that we have caught you we will put you into a trap that you cannot get out of
5142-33396-0068 so i lived and now am your tooth thrall well it is the luck of war
