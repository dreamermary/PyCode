4970-29093-0006 law seemed to him well enough as a science but he never could discover a practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law and all the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the ante room of the law office where he was writing philip invariably advised to settle no matter how but settle greatly to the disgust of his employer who knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the recognized processes with the attendant fees
