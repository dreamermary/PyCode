1188-133604-0000 you will find me continually speaking of four men titian holbein turner and tintoret in almost the same terms
1188-133604-0001 they unite every quality and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists sometimes as chiaroscurists
1188-133604-0002 by being studious of color they are studious of division and while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing unseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light
1188-133604-0003 my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side
1188-133604-0004 some of the touches indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge
1188-133604-0005 it is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of carpaccio's one of his series of the life of saint george
1188-133604-0006 then he comes to the beak of it
1188-133604-0007 the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible
1188-133604-0008 for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock robin is to be red and of a grass plot to be green and the best skill of art is in instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch
1188-133604-0009 now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly
1188-133604-0010 but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly
1188-133604-0011 they are beyond all other works that i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper
1188-133604-0012 it may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but loud or low the virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in loudness
1188-133604-0013 it must remember be one or the other
1188-133604-0014 do not therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one
1188-133604-0015 the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground
1188-133604-0016 this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions and that in fact you are producing jeweler's work rather than pictures
1188-133604-0017 that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous
1188-133604-0018 in all early gothic art indeed you will find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art
1188-133604-0019 the large letter contains indeed entirely feeble and ill drawn figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school
1188-133604-0020 but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination
1188-133604-0021 it will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquillity of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purist painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life
1188-133604-0022 you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you need not think to keep out of the way of him
1188-133604-0023 the colorist says first of all as my delicious paroquet was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black and then is the question can i round him off even though he is black and make him slimy and yet springy and close down clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth all the same
1188-133604-0024 nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter
1188-133604-0025 you know i have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire
1188-133604-0026 here is an equally typical greek school landscape by wilson lost wholly in golden mist the trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or towers and no care for color whatever perfectly deceptive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist apollo and the python
1188-133604-0027 now here is raphael exactly between the two trees still drawn leaf by leaf wholly formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance
1188-133604-0028 well then last here is turner's greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire
1188-133604-0029 only there are two sorts of cloud and fire
1188-133604-0030 he knows them both
1188-133604-0031 there's one and there's another the dudley and the flint
1188-133604-0032 it is only a pencil outline by edward burne jones in illustration of the story of psyche it is the introduction of psyche after all her troubles into heaven
1188-133604-0033 every plant in the grass is set formally grows perfectly and may be realized completely
1188-133604-0034 exquisite order and universal with eternal life and light this is the faith and effort of the schools of crystal and you may describe and complete their work quite literally by taking any verses of chaucer in his tender mood and observing how he insists on the clearness and brightness first and then on the order
1188-133604-0035 thus in chaucer's dream
1188-133604-0036 in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature though suffering is still dignified and beautiful
1188-133604-0037 every line in which the master traces it even where seemingly negligent is lovely and set down with a meditative calmness which makes these two etchings capable of being placed beside the most tranquil work of holbein or duerer
1188-133604-0038 but now here is a subject of which you will wonder at first why turner drew it at all
1188-133604-0039 it has no beauty whatsoever no specialty of picturesqueness and all its lines are cramped and poor
1188-133604-0040 the crampness and the poverty are all intended
1188-133604-0041 it is a gleaner bringing down her one sheaf of corn to an old watermill itself mossy and rent scarcely able to get its stones to turn
1188-133604-0042 the scene is absolutely arcadian
1188-133604-0043 see that your lives be in nothing worse than a boy's climbing for his entangled kite
1188-133604-0044 it will be well for you if you join not with those who instead of kites fly falcons who instead of obeying the last words of the great cloud shepherd to feed his sheep live the lives how much less than vanity of the war wolf and the gier eagle
