1580-141084-0000 it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind
1580-141084-0001 he was pacing swiftly up and down his room
1580-141084-0002 this set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them
1580-141084-0003 no names please said holmes as we knocked at gilchrist's door
1580-141084-0004 of course he did not realize that it was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather suspicious
1580-141084-0005 that is very important said holmes
1580-141084-0006 you don't seem to realize the position
1580-141084-0007 to morrow is the examination
1580-141084-0008 i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced
1580-141084-0009 it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action
1580-141084-0010 i will take the black clay with me also the pencil cuttings good bye
1580-141084-0011 when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up at the windows
1580-141084-0012 the foul mouthed fellow at the top
1580-141084-0013 he is the one with the worst record
1580-141084-0014 why bannister the servant what's his game in the matter
1580-141084-0015 he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man
1580-141084-0016 my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation
1580-141084-0017 no good my dear watson
1580-141084-0018 i think so you have formed a conclusion
1580-141084-0019 yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery
1580-141084-0020 look at that he held out his hand
1580-141084-0021 on the palm were three little pyramids of black doughy clay
1580-141084-0022 and one more this morning
1580-141084-0023 in a few hours the examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship
1580-141084-0024 he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come
1580-141084-0025 you know him i think so
1580-141084-0026 if this matter is not to become public we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial
1580-141084-0027 no sir certainly not
1580-141084-0028 there was no man sir
1580-141084-0029 his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner
1580-141084-0030 just close the door said holmes
1580-141084-0031 we want to know mister gilchrist how you an honourable man ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday
1580-141084-0032 for a moment gilchrist with upraised hand tried to control his writhing features
1580-141084-0033 come come said holmes kindly it is human to err and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal
1580-141084-0034 well well don't trouble to answer listen and see that i do you no injustice
1580-141084-0035 he could examine the papers in his own office
1580-141084-0036 the indian i also thought nothing of
1580-141084-0037 when i approached your room i examined the window
1580-141084-0038 no one less than that would have a chance
1580-141084-0039 i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table
1580-141084-0040 he returned carrying his jumping shoes which are provided as you are aware with several sharp spikes
1580-141084-0041 no harm would have been done had it not been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant
1580-141084-0042 a sudden impulse came over him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs
1580-141084-0043 he put his shoes on the table
1580-141084-0044 gloves said the young man
1580-141084-0045 suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible escape
1580-141084-0046 have i told the truth mister gilchrist
1580-141084-0047 i have a letter here mister soames which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night
1580-141084-0048 it will be clear to you from what i have said that only you could have let this young man out since you were left in the room and must have locked the door when you went out
1580-141084-0049 it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all your cleverness it was impossible that you could know
1580-141084-0050 if mister soames saw them the game was up
