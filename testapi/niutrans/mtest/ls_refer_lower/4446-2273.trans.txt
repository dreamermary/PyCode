4446-2273-0000 hilda was very nice to him and he sat on the edge of his chair flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar
4446-2273-0001 they asked him to come to see them in chelsea and they spoke very tenderly of hilda
4446-2273-0002 lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them i fancy
4446-2273-0003 when bartley arrived at bedford square on sunday evening marie the pretty little french girl met him at the door and conducted him upstairs
4446-2273-0004 i should never have asked you if molly had been here for i remember you don't like english cookery
4446-2273-0005 i haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place i think this is
4446-2273-0006 they are all sketches made about the villa d'este you see
4446-2273-0007 those fellows are all very loyal even mainhall
4446-2273-0008 i've managed to save something every year and that with helping my three sisters now and then and tiding poor cousin mike over bad seasons
4446-2273-0009 it's not particularly rare she said but some of it was my mother's
4446-2273-0010 there was watercress soup and sole and a delightful omelette stuffed with mushrooms and truffles and two small rare ducklings and artichokes and a dry yellow rhone wine of which bartley had always been very fond
4446-2273-0011 there is nothing else that looks so jolly
4446-2273-0012 thank you but i don't like it so well as this
4446-2273-0013 have you been in paris much these late years
4446-2273-0014 there are few changes in the old quarter
4446-2273-0015 don't i though i'm so sorry to hear it how did her son turn out
4446-2273-0016 her hair is still like flax and her blue eyes are just like a baby's and she has the same three freckles on her little nose and talks about going back to her bains de mer
4446-2273-0017 how jolly it was being young hilda
4446-2273-0018 do you remember that first walk we took together in paris
4446-2273-0019 come we'll have our coffee in the other room and you can smoke
4446-2273-0020 i think we did she answered demurely
4446-2273-0021 what she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs but just our youth
4446-2273-0022 they were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money god give you a happy love
4446-2273-0023 the strange woman and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply had frightened them both
4446-2273-0024 bartley started when hilda rang the little bell beside her dear me why did you do that
4446-2273-0025 it was very jolly he murmured lazily as marie came in to take away the coffee
4446-2273-0026 have i told you about my new play
4446-2273-0027 when she finished alexander shook himself out of a reverie
4446-2273-0028 nonsense of course i can't really sing except the way my mother and grandmother did before me
4446-2273-0029 it's really too warm in this room to sing don't you feel it
4446-2273-0030 alexander went over and opened the window for her
4446-2273-0031 there just in front
4446-2273-0032 he stood a little behind her and tried to steady himself as he said it's soft and misty see how white the stars are
4446-2273-0033 for a long time neither hilda nor bartley spoke
4446-2273-0034 he felt a tremor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him
4446-2273-0035 bartley leaned over her shoulder without touching her and whispered in her ear you are giving me a chance yes
4446-2273-0036 alexander unclenched the two hands at his sides
