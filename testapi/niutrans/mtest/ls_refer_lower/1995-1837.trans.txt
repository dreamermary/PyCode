1995-1837-0000 he knew the silver fleece his and zora's must be ruined
1995-1837-0001 it was the first great sorrow of his life it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself but the fantasy the hopes the dreams built around it
1995-1837-0002 ah the swamp the cruel swamp
1995-1837-0003 the revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder
1995-1837-0004 he panted to know if she too knew or knew and cared not or cared and knew not
1995-1837-0005 she was so strange and human a creature
1995-1837-0006 the world was water veiled in mists
1995-1837-0007 then of a sudden at midday the sun shot out hot and still no breath of air stirred the sky was like blue steel the earth steamed
1995-1837-0008 where was the use of imagining
1995-1837-0009 the lagoon had been level with the dykes a week ago and now
1995-1837-0010 perhaps she too might be there waiting weeping
1995-1837-0011 he started at the thought he hurried forth sadly
1995-1837-0012 he splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge
1995-1837-0013 then he looked down the lagoon was dry
1995-1837-0014 he stood a moment bewildered then turned and rushed upon the island a great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green thick tall wet and willowy
1995-1837-0015 the squares of cotton sharp edged heavy were just about to burst to bolls
1995-1837-0016 for one long moment he paused stupid agape with utter amazement then leaned dizzily against a tree
1995-1837-0017 he gazed about perplexed astonished
1995-1837-0018 here lay the reading of the riddle with infinite work and pain some one had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way thus allowing it to empty directly
1995-1837-0019 he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost zora
1995-1837-0020 the years of the days of her dying were ten
1995-1837-0021 the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land
1995-1837-0022 up in the sick room zora lay on the little white bed
1995-1837-0023 the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned
1995-1837-0024 for a while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at sun and bird and tree
1995-1837-0025 she rose with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl round her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp
1995-1837-0026 she had been born within its borders within its borders she had lived and grown and within its borders she had met her love
1995-1837-0027 on she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island lo the cotton lay before her
1995-1837-0028 the chair was empty but he knew
1995-1837-0029 he darted through the trees and paused a tall man strongly but slimly made
