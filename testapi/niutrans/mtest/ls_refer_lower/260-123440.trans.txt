260-123440-0000 and how odd the directions will look
260-123440-0001 poor alice
260-123440-0002 it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess
260-123440-0003 oh won't she be savage if i've kept her waiting
260-123440-0004 alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day
260-123440-0005 and yesterday things went on just as usual
260-123440-0006 i wonder if i've been changed in the night
260-123440-0007 i almost think i can remember feeling a little different
260-123440-0008 i'll try if i know all the things i used to know
260-123440-0009 i shall never get to twenty at that rate
260-123440-0010 how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws
260-123440-0011 no i've made up my mind about it if i'm mabel i'll stay down here
260-123440-0012 it'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear
260-123440-0013 i am so very tired of being all alone here
260-123440-0014 and i declare it's too bad that it is
260-123440-0015 i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out
260-123440-0016 i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears
260-123440-0017 that will be a queer thing to be sure
260-123440-0018 i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse
260-123440-0019 cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
260-123440-0020 we won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not we indeed
