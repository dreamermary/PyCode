908-157963-0000 to fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of adona her soft voice is heard and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew
908-157963-0001 o life of this our spring
908-157963-0002 why fades the lotus of the water
908-157963-0003 why fade these children of the spring
908-157963-0004 thel is like a watry bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon an infants face
908-157963-0005 like the doves voice like transient day like music in the air ah
908-157963-0006 and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gently hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time
908-157963-0007 the lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass answerd the lovely maid and said i am a watry weed and i am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales so weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head yet i am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all walks in the valley and each morn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou new born lily flower
908-157963-0008 thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shall be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal vales they why should thel complain
908-157963-0009 why should the mistress of the vales of har utter a sigh
908-157963-0010 she ceasd and smild in tears then sat down in her silver shrine
908-157963-0011 which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milked cow and tames the fire breathing steed
908-157963-0012 but thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun i vanish from my pearly throne and who shall find my place
908-157963-0013 and why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air
908-157963-0014 descend o little cloud and hover before the eyes of thel
908-157963-0015 o little cloud the virgin said i charge thee to tell me why thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away then we shall seek thee but not find ah thel is like to thee
908-157963-0016 i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice
908-157963-0017 the cloud then shewd his golden head and his bright form emerg'd
908-157963-0018 and fearest thou because i vanish and am seen no more
908-157963-0019 it is to tenfold life to love to peace and raptures holy unseen descending weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers and court the fair eyed dew to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun
908-157963-0020 till we arise link'd in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers
908-157963-0021 lives not alone nor or itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice
908-157963-0022 come forth worm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen
908-157963-0023 the helpless worm arose and sat upon the lillys leaf and the bright cloud saild on to find his partner in the vale
908-157963-0024 image of weakness art thou but a worm
908-157963-0025 i see they lay helpless and naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mothers smiles
908-157963-0026 and says thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given thee a crown that none can take away
908-157963-0027 and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot
908-157963-0028 or an eye of gifts and graces showring fruits and coined gold
908-157963-0029 why a tongue impress'd with honey from every wind
908-157963-0030 why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in
