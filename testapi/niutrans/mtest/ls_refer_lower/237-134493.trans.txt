237-134493-0000 it is sixteen years since john bergson died
237-134493-0001 his wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheat fields
237-134493-0002 from the norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checker board marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
237-134493-0003 from the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gayly painted farmhouses the gilded weather vanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
237-134493-0004 the air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
237-134493-0005 he was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a handsome head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
237-134493-0006 that's not much of a job for an athlete here i've been to town and back
237-134493-0007 alexandra lets you sleep late
237-134493-0008 she gathered up her reins
237-134493-0009 please wait for me marie emil coaxed
237-134493-0010 i never see lou's scythe over here
237-134493-0011 how brown you've got since you came home i wish i had an athlete to mow my orchard
237-134493-0012 i get wet to my knees when i go down to pick cherries
237-134493-0013 indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not seeing it
237-134493-0014 they think you're proud because you've been away to school or something
237-134493-0015 there was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
237-134493-0016 on either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange hedges their glossy green marking off the yellow fields
237-134493-0017 any one thereabouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the divide and that the farmer was a woman alexandra bergson
237-134493-0018 there is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees
