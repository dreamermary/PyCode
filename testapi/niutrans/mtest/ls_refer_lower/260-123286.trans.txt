260-123286-0000 saturday august fifteenth the sea unbroken all round no land in sight
260-123286-0001 the horizon seems extremely distant
260-123286-0002 all my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him but now that i am well his nature has resumed its sway
260-123286-0003 you seem anxious my uncle i said seeing him continually with his glass to his eye anxious
260-123286-0004 one might be with less reason than now
260-123286-0005 i am not complaining that the rate is slow but that the sea is so wide
260-123286-0006 we are losing time and the fact is i have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft
260-123286-0007 he called this sea a pond and our long voyage taking a little sail
260-123286-0008 therefore don't talk to me about views and prospects
260-123286-0009 i take this as my answer and i leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience
260-123286-0010 sunday august sixteenth
260-123286-0011 nothing new weather unchanged the wind freshens
260-123286-0012 but there seemed no reason to fear
260-123286-0013 the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves
260-123286-0014 truly this sea is of infinite width
260-123286-0015 it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlantic and why not
260-123286-0016 these thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleep
260-123286-0017 i shudder as i recall these monsters to my remembrance
260-123286-0018 i saw at the hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length
260-123286-0019 i suppose professor liedenbrock was of my opinion too and even shared my fears for after having examined the pick his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side
260-123286-0020 tuesday august eighteenth
260-123286-0021 during his watch i slept
260-123286-0022 two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me
260-123286-0023 the raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms
260-123286-0024 there's a whale a whale cried the professor
260-123286-0025 flight was out of the question now the reptiles rose they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains
260-123286-0026 two monsters only were creating all this commotion and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world
260-123286-0027 i can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal and as large as a man's head
260-123286-0028 its jaw is enormous and according to naturalists it is armed with no less than one hundred and eighty two teeth
260-123286-0029 those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity
260-123286-0030 suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water
260-123286-0031 as for the ichthyosaurus has he returned to his submarine cavern
