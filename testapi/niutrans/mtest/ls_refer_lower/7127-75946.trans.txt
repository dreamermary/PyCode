7127-75946-0000 at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court
7127-75946-0001 ah very well
7127-75946-0002 let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself au courant with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers
7127-75946-0003 gentlemen to your posts whereupon saint aignan and villeroy took their leave
7127-75946-0004 certainly sire but i must have money to do that what
7127-75946-0005 what do you mean inquired louis
7127-75946-0006 he has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment
7127-75946-0007 it is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned
7127-75946-0008 does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attempt
7127-75946-0009 not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me
7127-75946-0010 your majesty's plan then in this affair is
7127-75946-0011 you will take them from my private treasure
7127-75946-0012 the news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry desire and wild ambition
7127-75946-0013 the king had completed his toilette by nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers
7127-75946-0014 the queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dias or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction
7127-75946-0015 suddenly for the purpose of restoring peace and order spring accompanied by his whole court made his appearance
7127-75946-0016 the seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quadrille which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance
7127-75946-0017 his legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself
7127-75946-0018 there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seem to soar along
7127-75946-0019 yes it is suppressed
7127-75946-0020 far from it sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musicians have retained it
7127-75946-0021 yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet
7127-75946-0022 sire he said your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shown on the field of battle
7127-75946-0023 the king seemed only pleased with every one present
7127-75946-0024 monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter
7127-75946-0025 the ballet began the effect was more than beautiful
7127-75946-0026 when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theater shook with tumultuous applause
7127-75946-0027 disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgement he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess
7127-75946-0028 by degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied
7127-75946-0029 the king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille cast a look upon his vanquished rival
