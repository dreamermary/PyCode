7021-79730-0000 the three modes of management
7021-79730-0001 to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design
7021-79730-0002 by reason and affection
7021-79730-0003 as the chaise drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill humor surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps an irreparable injury
7021-79730-0004 the mother as soon as the chaise is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her countenance goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction upon her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice
7021-79730-0005 so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you
7021-79730-0006 the mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection
7021-79730-0007 if you should not be a good girl but should show signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone
7021-79730-0008 but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble
7021-79730-0009 it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated
