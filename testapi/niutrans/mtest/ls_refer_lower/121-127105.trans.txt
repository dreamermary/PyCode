121-127105-0000 it was this observation that drew from douglas not immediately but later in the evening a reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention
121-127105-0001 someone else told a story not particularly effective which i saw he was not following
121-127105-0002 cried one of the women he took no notice of her he looked at me but as if instead of me he saw what he spoke of
121-127105-0003 there was a unanimous groan at this and much reproach after which in his preoccupied way he explained
121-127105-0004 the story's written
121-127105-0005 i could write to my man and enclose the key he could send down the packet as he finds it
121-127105-0006 the others resented postponement but it was just his scruples that charmed me
121-127105-0007 to this his answer was prompt oh thank god no and is the record yours
121-127105-0008 he hung fire again a woman's
121-127105-0009 she has been dead these twenty years
121-127105-0010 she sent me the pages in question before she died
121-127105-0011 she was the most agreeable woman i've ever known in her position she would have been worthy of any whatever
121-127105-0012 it wasn't simply that she said so but that i knew she hadn't i was sure i could see
121-127105-0013 you'll easily judge why when you hear because the thing had been such a scare he continued to fix me
121-127105-0014 you are acute
121-127105-0015 he quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair
121-127105-0016 probably not till the second post
121-127105-0017 it was almost the tone of hope everybody will stay
121-127105-0018 cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed
121-127105-0019 missus griffin however expressed the need for a little more light
121-127105-0020 who was it she was in love with the story will tell i took upon myself to reply oh i can't wait for the story the story won't tell said douglas not in any literal vulgar way more's the pity then
121-127105-0021 won't you tell douglas
121-127105-0022 well if i don't know who she was in love with i know who he was
121-127105-0023 let me say here distinctly to have done with it that this narrative from an exact transcript of my own made much later is what i shall presently give
121-127105-0024 poor douglas before his death when it was in sight committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that on the same spot with immense effect he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth
121-127105-0025 the departing ladies who had said they would stay didn't of course thank heaven stay they departed in consequence of arrangements made in a rage of curiosity as they professed produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up
121-127105-0026 the first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had in a manner begun
121-127105-0027 he had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase but it was to his country home an old family place in essex that he wished her immediately to proceed
121-127105-0028 the awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time
121-127105-0029 there were plenty of people to help but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority
121-127105-0030 i don't anticipate
121-127105-0031 she was young untried nervous it was a vision of serious duties and little company of really great loneliness
121-127105-0032 yes but that's just the beauty of her passion
121-127105-0033 it was the beauty of it
121-127105-0034 it sounded dull it sounded strange and all the more so because of his main condition which was
121-127105-0035 she promised to do this and she mentioned to me that when for a moment disburdened delighted he held her hand thanking her for the sacrifice she already felt rewarded
121-127105-0036 but was that all her reward one of the ladies asked
