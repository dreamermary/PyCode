5683-32879-0000 it was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of redman's farm
5683-32879-0001 well she was better though she had had a bad night
5683-32879-0002 so there came a step and a little rustling of feminine draperies the small door opened and rachel entered with her hand extended and a pale smile of welcome
5683-32879-0003 women can hide their pain better than we men and bear it better too except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice
5683-32879-0004 but poor rachel lake had more than that stoical hypocrisy which enables the tortured spirits of her sex to lift a pale face through the flames and smile
5683-32879-0005 this transient spring and lighting up are beautiful a glamour beguiling our senses
5683-32879-0006 there was something of sweetness and fondness in her tones and manner which was new to rachel and comforting and she returned the greeting as kindly and felt more like her former self
5683-32879-0007 rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise
5683-32879-0008 you have been so ill my poor rachel
5683-32879-0009 ill and troubled dear troubled in mind and miserably nervous
5683-32879-0010 poor rachel her nature recoiled from deceit and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared
5683-32879-0011 she spoke with a sudden energy which partook of fear and passion and flushed her thin cheek and made her languid eyes flash
5683-32879-0012 thank you rachel my cousin rachel my only friend
5683-32879-0013 chelford had a note from mister wylder this morning another note his coming delayed and something of his having to see some person who is abroad continued dorcas after a little pause
5683-32879-0014 yes something everything said rachel hurriedly looking frowningly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers
5683-32879-0015 yes said rachel
5683-32879-0016 and the wan oracle having spoken she sate down in the same sort of abstraction again beside dorcas and she looked full in her cousin's eyes
5683-32879-0017 of mark wylder i say this his name has been for years hateful to me and recently it has become frightful and you will promise me simply this that you will never ask me to speak again about him
5683-32879-0018 it is an antipathy an antipathy i cannot get over dear dorcas you may think it a madness but don't blame me
5683-32879-0019 i have very few to love me now and i thought you might love me as i have begun to love you
5683-32879-0020 and she threw her arms round her cousin's neck and brave rachel at last burst into tears
5683-32879-0021 dorcas in her strange way was moved
5683-32879-0022 i like you still rachel i'm sure i'll always like you
5683-32879-0023 you resemble me rachel you are fearless and inflexible and generous
5683-32879-0024 yes rachel i do love you
5683-32879-0025 thank you dorcas dear
