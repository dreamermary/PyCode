5105-28240-0000 fast as his legs could carry him servadac had made his way to the top of the cliff
5105-28240-0001 it was quite true that a vessel was in sight hardly more than six miles from the shore but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity and the consequent limitation of the range of vision the rigging of the topmasts alone was visible above the water
5105-28240-0002 exclaimed servadac keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope
5105-28240-0003 she is under sail but she is count timascheff's yacht he was right
5105-28240-0004 if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival
5105-28240-0005 he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe but upon learning its cause
5105-28240-0006 the wind being adverse the dobryna did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course
5105-28240-0007 servadac took it for granted that the dobryna was endeavoring to put in
5105-28240-0008 a narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea and which even in the roughest weather would ensure the calmness of its waters
5105-28240-0009 slightly changing her course she first struck her mainsail and in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman soon carried nothing but her two topsails brigantine and jib
5105-28240-0010 captain servadac hastened towards him
5105-28240-0011 i left you on a continent and here i have the honor of finding you on an island
5105-28240-0012 never mind now interposed the captain we will talk of that by and by
5105-28240-0013 nothing more than you know yourself
5105-28240-0014 are you certain that this is the mediterranean
5105-28240-0015 for some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied then recovering himself he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions
5105-28240-0016 to all these inquiries the count responded in the affirmative
5105-28240-0017 some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements
5105-28240-0018 you will take me on board count will you not
5105-28240-0019 my yacht is at your service sir even should you require to make a tour round the world
5105-28240-0020 the count shook his head
5105-28240-0021 before starting it was indispensable that the engine of the dobryna should be repaired to sail under canvas only would in contrary winds and rough seas be both tedious and difficult
5105-28240-0022 it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed
5105-28240-0023 a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide
5105-28240-0024 doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for ben zoof to accompany his master
