7729-102255-0001 this was at the march election eighteen fifty five
7729-102255-0002 that summer's emigration however being mainly from the free states greatly changed the relative strength of the two parties
7729-102255-0003 for general service therefore requiring no special effort the numerical strength of the factions was about equal while on extraordinary occasions the two thousand border ruffian reserve lying a little farther back from the state line could at any time easily turn the scale
7729-102255-0004 the free state men had only their convictions their intelligence their courage and the moral support of the north the conspiracy had its secret combination the territorial officials the legislature the bogus laws the courts the militia officers the president and the army
7729-102255-0005 this was a formidable array of advantages slavery was playing with loaded dice
7729-102255-0006 coming by way of the missouri river towns he fell first among border ruffian companionship and influences and perhaps having his inclinations already molded by his washington instructions his early impressions were decidedly adverse to the free state cause
7729-102255-0007 his reception speech at westport in which he maintained the legality of the legislature and his determination to enforce their laws delighted his pro slavery auditors
7729-102255-0008 all the territorial dignitaries were present governor shannon presided john calhoun the surveyor general made the principal speech a denunciation of the abolitionists supporting the topeka movement chief justice lecompte dignified the occasion with approving remarks
7729-102255-0009 all dissent all non compliance all hesitation all mere silence even were in their stronghold towns like leavenworth branded as abolitionism declared to be hostility to the public welfare and punished with proscription personal violence expulsion and frequently death
7729-102255-0010 of the lynchings the mobs and the murders it would be impossible except in a very extended work to note the frequent and atrocious details
7729-102255-0011 the present chapters can only touch upon the more salient movements of the civil war in kansas which happily were not sanguinary if however the individual and more isolated cases of bloodshed could be described they would show a startling aggregate of barbarity and loss of life for opinion's sake
7729-102255-0012 several hundred free state men promptly responded to the summons
7729-102255-0013 it was in fact the best weapon of its day
7729-102255-0014 the leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town
7729-102255-0015 one of his militia generals suggested that the governor should require the outlaws at lawrence and elsewhere to surrender the sharps rifles another wrote asking him to call out the government troops at fort leavenworth
7729-102255-0016 the governor on his part becoming doubtful of the legality of employing missouri militia to enforce kansas laws was also eager to secure the help of federal troops
7729-102255-0017 sheriff jones had his pockets always full of writs issued in the spirit of persecution but was often baffled by the sharp wits and ready resources of the free state people and sometimes defied outright
7729-102255-0018 little by little however the latter became hemmed and bound in the meshes of the various devices and proceedings which the territorial officials evolved from the bogus laws
7729-102255-0019 to embarrass this damaging exposure judge lecompte issued a writ against the ex governor on a frivolous charge of contempt
7729-102255-0020 the incident was not violent nor even dramatic no posse was summoned no further effort made and reeder fearing personal violence soon fled in disguise
7729-102255-0021 but the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free state men were insurrectionists and outlaws
7729-102255-0022 from these again sprang barricaded and fortified dwellings camps and scouting parties finally culminating in roving guerrilla bands half partisan half predatory
7729-102255-0023 their distinctive characters however display one broad and unfailing difference
7729-102255-0024 the free state men clung to their prairie towns and prairie ravines with all the obstinacy and courage of true defenders of their homes and firesides
7729-102255-0025 their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities

7729-102255-0028 private persons who had leased the free state hotel vainly besought the various authorities to prevent the destruction of their property
7729-102255-0029 ten days were consumed in these negotiations but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield
7729-102255-0030 he summoned half a dozen citizens to join his posse who followed obeyed and assisted him
7729-102255-0031 he continued his pretended search and to give color to his errand made two arrests
7729-102255-0032 the free state hotel a stone building in dimensions fifty by seventy feet three stories high and handsomely furnished previously occupied only for lodging rooms on that day for the first time opened its table accommodations to the public and provided a free dinner in honor of the occasion
7729-102255-0033 as he had promised to protect the hotel the reassured citizens began to laugh at their own fears
7729-102255-0034 to their sorrow they were soon undeceived
7729-102255-0035 the military force partly rabble partly organized had meanwhile moved into the town
7729-102255-0036 he planted a company before the hotel and demanded a surrender of the arms belonging to the free state military companies
7729-102255-0037 half an hour later turning a deaf ear to all remonstrance he gave the proprietors until five o'clock to remove their families and personal property from the free state hotel
7729-102255-0038 atchison who had been haranguing the mob planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it

7729-102255-0040 in this incident contrasting the creative and the destructive spirit of the factions the emigrant aid society of massachusetts finds its most honorable and triumphant vindication
7729-102255-0041 the whole proceeding was so childish the miserable plot so transparent the outrage so gross as to bring disgust to the better class of border ruffians who were witnesses and accessories

7729-102255-0044 here he was placed in the custody of captain martin of the kickapoo rangers who proved a kind jailer and materially assisted in protecting him from the dangerous intentions of the mob which at that time held leavenworth under a reign of terror
7729-102255-0045 captain martin said i shall give you a pistol to help protect yourself if worse comes to worst
7729-102255-0046 in the early morning of the next day may twenty ninth a company of dragoons with one empty saddle came down from the fort and while the pro slavery men still slept the prisoner and his escort were on their way across the prairies to lecompton in the charge of officers of the united states army
