6930-76324-0000 goliath makes another discovery
6930-76324-0001 they were certainly no nearer the solution of their problem
6930-76324-0002 the poor little things cried cynthia think of them having been turned to the wall all these years
6930-76324-0003 now what was the sense of it two innocent babies like that
6930-76324-0004 but joyce had not been listening all at once she put down her candle on the table and faced her companion
6930-76324-0005 the twin brother did something she didn't like and she turned his picture to the wall
6930-76324-0006 hers happened to be in the same frame too but she evidently didn't care about that
6930-76324-0007 now what have you to say cynthia sprague
6930-76324-0008 i thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture but it's been of some use after all
6930-76324-0009 do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing
6930-76324-0010 what in the world is that queried joyce
6930-76324-0011 they worry me terribly and besides i'd like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it good scheme cyn
6930-76324-0012 we'll come in here this afternoon with old clothes on and have a regular house cleaning
6930-76324-0013 it can't hurt anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all
6930-76324-0014 this thought however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair
6930-76324-0015 smuggling the house cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for cynthia had added a whisk broom and dust pan to the outfit
6930-76324-0016 the lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after it as friskily as a young kitten much to cynthia's delight when she caught sight of him
6930-76324-0017 oh let him come along she urged i do love to see him about that old house
6930-76324-0018 he makes it sort of cozier
6930-76324-0019 now let's dust the furniture and pictures
6930-76324-0020 yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room
6930-76324-0021 surface dust at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish
6930-76324-0022 then she suddenly remarked
6930-76324-0023 and my pocket money is getting low again and you haven't any left as usual
6930-76324-0024 they say illumination by candle light is the prettiest in the world
6930-76324-0025 why it's goliath as usual they both cried peering in
6930-76324-0026 isn't he the greatest for getting into odd corners
6930-76324-0027 forgetting all their weariness they seized their candles and scurried through the house finding an occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner
6930-76324-0028 well i'm convinced that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later
