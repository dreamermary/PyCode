1995-1836-0000 the hon charles smith miss sarah's brother was walking swiftly uptown from mister easterly's wall street office and his face was pale
1995-1836-0001 at last the cotton combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the senate
1995-1836-0002 why should he not be as other men
1995-1836-0003 she was not herself a notably intelligent woman she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others
1995-1836-0004 as she awaited her guests she surveyed the table with both satisfaction and disquietude for her social functions were few tonight there were she checked them off on her fingers sir james creighton the rich english manufacturer and lady creighton mister and missus vanderpool mister harry cresswell and his sister john taylor and his sister and mister charles smith whom the evening papers mentioned as likely to be united states senator from new jersey a selection of guests that had been determined unknown to the hostess by the meeting of cotton interests earlier in the day
1995-1836-0005 missus grey had met southerners before but not intimately and she always had in mind vividly their cruelty to poor negroes a subject she made a point of introducing forthwith
1995-1836-0006 she was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister cresswell express himself so cordially as approving of negro education
1995-1836-0007 but you believe in some education asked mary taylor
1995-1836-0008 i believe in the training of people to their highest capacity the englishman here heartily seconded him
1995-1836-0009 but cresswell added significantly capacity differs enormously between races
1995-1836-0010 the vanderpools were sure of this and the englishman instancing india became quite eloquent missus grey was mystified but hardly dared admit it the general trend of the conversation seemed to be that most individuals needed to be submitted to the sharpest scrutiny before being allowed much education and as for the lower races it was simply criminal to open such useless opportunities to them
1995-1836-0011 positively heroic added cresswell avoiding his sister's eyes
1995-1836-0012 but we're not er exactly welcomed
1995-1836-0013 mary taylor however related the tale of zora to missus grey's private ear later
1995-1836-0014 fortunately said mister vanderpool northerners and southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters
