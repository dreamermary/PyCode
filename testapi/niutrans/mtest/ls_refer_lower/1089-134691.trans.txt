1089-134691-0000 he could wait no longer
1089-134691-0001 for a full hour he had paced up and down waiting but he could wait no longer
1089-134691-0002 he set off abruptly for the bull walking rapidly lest his father's shrill whistle might call him back and in a few moments he had rounded the curve at the police barrack and was safe
1089-134691-0003 the university
1089-134691-0004 pride after satisfaction uplifted him like long slow waves
1089-134691-0005 whose feet are as the feet of harts and underneath the everlasting arms
1089-134691-0006 the pride of that dim image brought back to his mind the dignity of the office he had refused
1089-134691-0007 soon the whole bridge was trembling and resounding
1089-134691-0008 the uncouth faces passed him two by two stained yellow or red or livid by the sea and as he strove to look at them with ease and indifference a faint stain of personal shame and commiseration rose to his own face
1089-134691-0009 angry with himself he tried to hide his face from their eyes by gazing down sideways into the shallow swirling water under the bridge but he still saw a reflection therein of their top heavy silk hats and humble tape like collars and loosely hanging clerical clothes brother hickey
1089-134691-0010 brother mac ardle brother keogh
1089-134691-0011 their piety would be like their names like their faces like their clothes and it was idle for him to tell himself that their humble and contrite hearts it might be paid a far richer tribute of devotion than his had ever been a gift tenfold more acceptable than his elaborate adoration
1089-134691-0012 it was idle for him to move himself to be generous towards them to tell himself that if he ever came to their gates stripped of his pride beaten and in beggar's weeds that they would be generous towards him loving him as themselves
1089-134691-0013 idle and embittering finally to argue against his own dispassionate certitude that the commandment of love bade us not to love our neighbour as ourselves with the same amount and intensity of love but to love him as ourselves with the same kind of love
1089-134691-0014 the phrase and the day and the scene harmonized in a chord
1089-134691-0015 words was it their colours
1089-134691-0016 they were voyaging across the deserts of the sky a host of nomads on the march voyaging high over ireland westward bound
1089-134691-0017 the europe they had come from lay out there beyond the irish sea europe of strange tongues and valleyed and woodbegirt and citadelled and of entrenched and marshalled races
1089-134691-0018 again again
1089-134691-0019 a voice from beyond the world was calling
1089-134691-0020 hello stephanos here comes the dedalus
1089-134691-0021 their diving stone poised on its rude supports and rocking under their plunges and the rough hewn stones of the sloping breakwater over which they scrambled in their horseplay gleamed with cold wet lustre
1089-134691-0022 he stood still in deference to their calls and parried their banter with easy words
1089-134691-0023 it was a pain to see them and a sword like pain to see the signs of adolescence that made repellent their pitiable nakedness
1089-134691-0024 stephanos dedalos
1089-134691-0025 a moment before the ghost of the ancient kingdom of the danes had looked forth through the vesture of the hazewrapped city
