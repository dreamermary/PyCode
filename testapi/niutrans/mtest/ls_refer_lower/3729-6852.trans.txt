3729-6852-0000 to celebrate the arrival of her son silvia gave a splendid supper to which she had invited all her relatives and it was a good opportunity for me to make their acquaintance
3729-6852-0001 without saying it positively she made me understand that being herself an illustrious member of the republic of letters she was well aware that she was speaking to an insect
3729-6852-0002 in order to please her i spoke to her of the abbe conti and i had occasion to quote two lines of that profound writer
3729-6852-0003 madam corrected me with a patronizing air for my pronunciation of the word scevra which means divided saying that it ought to be pronounced sceura and she added that i ought to be very glad to have learned so much on the first day of my arrival in paris telling me that it would be an important day in my life
3729-6852-0004 her face was an enigma for it inspired everyone with the warmest sympathy and yet if you examined it attentively there was not one beautiful feature she could not be called handsome but no one could have thought her ugly
3729-6852-0005 silvia was the adoration of france and her talent was the real support of all the comedies which the greatest authors wrote for her especially of the plays of marivaux for without her his comedies would never have gone to posterity
3729-6852-0006 silvia did not think that her good conduct was a merit for she knew that she was virtuous only because her self love compelled her to be so and she never exhibited any pride or assumed any superiority towards her theatrical sisters although satisfied to shine by their talent or their beauty they cared little about rendering themselves conspicuous by their virtue
3729-6852-0007 two years before her death i saw her perform the character of marianne in the comedy of marivaux and in spite of her age and declining health the illusion was complete
3729-6852-0008 she was honourably buried in the church of saint sauveur without the slightest opposition from the venerable priest who far from sharing the anti christain intolerancy of the clergy in general said that her profession as an actress had not hindered her from being a good christian and that the earth was the common mother of all human beings as jesus christ had been the saviour of all mankind
3729-6852-0009 you will forgive me dear reader if i have made you attend the funeral of silvia ten years before her death believe me i have no intention of performing a miracle you may console yourself with the idea that i shall spare you that unpleasant task when poor silvia dies
3729-6852-0010 i never had any family
3729-6852-0011 i had a name i believe in my young days but i have forgotten it since i have been in service
3729-6852-0012 i shall call you esprit
3729-6852-0013 you do me a great honour
3729-6852-0014 here go and get me change for a louis i have it sir
3729-6852-0015 at your service sir
3729-6852-0016 madame quinson besides can answer your enquiries
3729-6852-0017 i see a quantity of chairs for hire at the rate of one sou men reading the newspaper under the shade of the trees girls and men breakfasting either alone or in company waiters who were rapidly going up and down a narrow staircase hidden under the foliage
3729-6852-0018 i sit down at a small table a waiter comes immediately to enquire my wishes
3729-6852-0019 i tell him to give me some coffee if it is good
3729-6852-0020 then turning towards me he says that i look like a foreigner and when i say that i am an italian he begins to speak to me of the court of the city of the theatres and at last he offers to accompany me everywhere
3729-6852-0021 i thank him and take my leave
3729-6852-0022 i address him in italian and he answers very wittily but his way of speaking makes me smile and i tell him why
3729-6852-0023 my remark pleases him but i soon prove to him that it is not the right way to speak however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer
3729-6852-0024 i see a crowd in one corner of the garden everybody standing still and looking up
3729-6852-0025 is there not a meridian everywhere
3729-6852-0026 yes but the meridian of the palais royal is the most exact
3729-6852-0027 that is true badauderie
3729-6852-0028 all these honest persons are waiting their turn to get their snuff boxes filled
3729-6852-0029 it is sold everywhere but for the last three weeks nobody will use any snuff but that sold at the civet cat
3729-6852-0030 is it better than anywhere else
3729-6852-0031 but how did she manage to render it so fashionable
3729-6852-0032 simply by stopping her carriage two or three times before the shop to have her snuff box filled and by saying aloud to the young girl who handed back the box that her snuff was the very best in paris
3729-6852-0033 you are now in the only country in the world where wit can make a fortune by selling either a genuine or a false article in the first case it receives the welcome of intelligent and talented people and in the second fools are always ready to reward it for silliness is truly a characteristic of the people here and however wonderful it may appear silliness is the daughter of wit
3729-6852-0034 let a man run and everybody will run after him the crowd will not stop unless the man is proved to be mad but to prove it is indeed a difficult task because we have a crowd of men who mad from their birth are still considered wise
3729-6852-0035 it seems to me i replied that such approval such ratification of the opinion expressed by the king the princes of the blood et cetera is rather a proof of the affection felt for them by the nation for the french carry that affection to such an extent that they believe them infallible
3729-6852-0036 when the king comes to paris everybody calls out vive le roi
3729-6852-0037 she introduced me to all her guests and gave me some particulars respecting every one of them
3729-6852-0038 what sir i said to him am i fortunate enough to see you
3729-6852-0039 he himself recited the same passage in french and politely pointed out the parts in which he thought that i had improved on the original
3729-6852-0040 for the first day sir i think that what you have done gives great hopes of you and without any doubt you will make rapid progress
3729-6852-0041 i believe it sir and that is what i fear therefore the principal object of my visit here is to devote myself entirely to the study of the french language
3729-6852-0042 i am a very unpleasant pupil always asking questions curious troublesome insatiable and even supposing that i could meet with the teacher i require i am afraid i am not rich enough to pay him
3729-6852-0043 i reside in the marais rue de douze portes
3729-6852-0044 i will make you translate them into french and you need not be afraid of my finding you insatiable
3729-6852-0045 he had a good appetite could tell a good story without laughing was celebrated for his witty repartees and his sociable manners but he spent his life at home seldom going out and seeing hardly anyone because he always had a pipe in his mouth and was surrounded by at least twenty cats with which he would amuse himself all day
3729-6852-0046 his housekeeper had the management of everything she never allowed him to be in need of anything and she gave no account of his money which she kept altogether because he never asked her to render any accounts
